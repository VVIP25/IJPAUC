			<p>Investigator Budds observed the location to be a movie set within the Indian Dunes Park. The movie set depicted a Vietnamese village constructed at the base of an approximately 100-foot-high, sheer-faced cliff. The Santa Clara River ran in an east-west direction adjacent to and just north of the simulated village. This river had been enlarged by the formation of a man-made dam west of the village. This dam was downstream, which caused the river to back up, widening and deepening the normal river size. (Police Report)</p>

			<p>In the 3rd draft of “Twilight Zone—Landis Episode,” dated June 13th, 1982, a new Vietnamese Village sequence was added (Scenes 28-32) in which the anti-hero protagonist redeems himself by rescuing two orphans from a marauding combat helicopter. In an effort to maximize cinematic realism despite labor laws, the filmmakers conspired to hire two children for the parts illegally (without permits). The conspiracy would spiral to include several lower-ranked members of the production, forcing them to risk their careers by speaking out, or else be made complicit.</p>

			<a id="section-01a"></a><h4>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 16th</h4>
			<p>Associate casting agent, Marci Liroff, of Fenton & Fineberg Casting, although just 24-years-old, had already worked with Amblin Entertainment twice before, on <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> (1982) and <span class="movietitle">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</span> (1982).</p>
			<p>On July 7th, 1983, police investigators spoke with Liroff, who said:</p>
	
			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>... on 6/16/82 she had been one of four people at a "Casting Session" which took place in John Landis' office at Universal Studios. Present at the casting session were herself, her boss (Mike Fenton), George Folsey, and John Landis. During this session, Mr. Landis explained to everyone present that the character ("Bill") being portrayed by VICTOR MORROW in the Landis episode was coming across too harsh in the movie. Mr. Landis said that during the previous evening, he had come up with an idea, "softening Morrow's character." Mr. Landis explained that his idea included Vic Morrow running across a river at night being pursued by a helicopter which would be firing simulated machine gunfire. As Mr. Morrow was running across the river, he would be carrying two children. This scene was supposed to depict Vic Morrow rescuing these two Vietnamese children as a Vietnamese Village was under attack. Mr. Landis continued that, as Mr. Morrow crossed the river carrying the two children, numerous large explosions would be occurring to either side and to the front and back of the actors.</p>
				<p>Mr. Landis told Ms. Liroff that they wanted her to obtain two children “Vietnamese, Korean or Thai, approximately 6 or 7 years of age” for use in the aforementioned scene. She stated that based on the children being in close proximity to explosions and close proximity to a helicopter, there was no way she would be involved in hiring the children.</p>
				<p>She also explained that because of the danger, there was no way they could obtain necessary permits through the normal channels. She stated that she continued explaining to Mr. Landis and those present that additionally, the entire scene was to be shot in the late night and early morning hours and for that reason and in addition to the danger, there was no way proper permits could be obtained. Ms. Liroff continued by telling Mr. Landis that she would not be involved with the procurement of the children for this scene. She stated that her boss, Mike Fenton, concurred with her.</p>
				<p>Ms. Liroff continued that John Landis, after receiving her refusal to obtain the children, immediately turned towards George Folsey and began to hold a conversation with him. During this time, Dan Allingham entered the office. Ms. Liroff stated that Landis, Folsey, and Allingham began having a conversation about hiring children in spite of the fact that they couldn't get them through normal legal channels.</p>
				<p>She stated that John Landis told Folsey and Allingham that they would "just have to get the kids off the street, we won't put them on any records and we won't tell anyone what we're doing."</p>
				<p>She recalls that George Folsey commented something to the effect, "Okay fine, that's how we'll do it." (Police report)</p>
			</div>

			<p>Liroff also supplied the police with her casting notes for the day, where she’d written, “Two Vietnamese kids, boy/girl (Chinese or Korean, Thai. Two nights.)”</p>
			<p>Besides substantiating that Landis had asked them to procure children at all (which Landis denied), Liroff’s testimony also established that the filmmakers believed that the shooting would or could take “two nights.” </p>
			<p>This is significant because the parents were only given an <a href="#section-01e">abridged version of the sequence</a> before committing to participate, and were told they would only be needed between 7:00pm—1:00am on a single night. But once they arrived on set, the filmmakers casually and repeatedly extended the families’ time commitment across two nights, past the point where all four parents were able to supervise their children as planned, and to the point of exhaustion. Along with the misrepresentation of the danger involved, then, the misrepresentation of the time commitment—if it was known or anticipated by any of the key figures involved—is a major issue in assessing culpability.</p>
			<p>By 1984, Liroff added to her police statement, going on the record about the involvement of Executive Producer Frank Marshall (<span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>, <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>).</p>
			<p>She testified that two days after the alarming casting session, during a scheduled production phone call with Marshall, whom she knew from her work on <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, she alerted him to Landis’s explicitly-stated intentions to hire children “off the street.” He told her he would take care of it.</p>
			<p>During cross-examination, the defense suggested that she couldn’t have been that alarmed about Landis’s statements, given that she didn’t follow-up about the matter further.</p>
			<p>Liroff responded, “I told the director it was illegal. I told the producer, the production manager. I didn’t know it was my job to be a policeman. In hindsight I wish I had.” (qtd. in LaBrecque, 162)</p>

			<a id="section-01b"></a><h4>TUESDAY, JULY 6th</h4>

			<p>The issue of the children lay dormant for the rest of June. Landis’s group filmed his prologue to the movie, “Real Scary,” at the end of June, with production of the “Landis episode” coming week by week in July.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the new Vietnamese Village sequence was still awaiting official studio approval. Landis requested $300,000, but received addition to the segment’s planned $1,000,000 budget (Chain Ch. 18). Landis turned in another, final draft on June 26th, 1982, but it contained only <a href="#section-16b">a few minor adjustments.</a></p>
			<p>After the production got notice that the budget had been officially approved by the studio, <a href="#section-04n">the account of how the hiring proceeded varies.</a></p>
			<p>The problem was that according to California state labor laws, well-known within the film industry, children under the age of 8 could only be worked until 6:30pm.</p>
			<p>Marshall has never accounted for basic questions concerning his failure to prevent the illegal hiring of the two children for a dangerous practical effects scene despite being alerted to Landis’s intention to do exactly that over a month in advance.</p>
			<p>Defendants Landis, Folsey, and Allingham, for their part, have consistently maintained that after the budget was approved, Marshall twice visited their offices, an assemblage of trailers on the Universal Studios lot, to address the practical issue presented by the addition of the Vietnamese Village rescue sequence to the script: once early in the week of July 5-9th, 1982, and once at the end of that same week (see Braun’s letters to the DA; Landis’s trial attorney James Neal’s opening statement; Landis’s trial testimony; Folsey’s interviews with journalists).</p>
			<p>The discussion the first day, the defendants say, turned on whether it would be possible for the production to get waivers from the labor board that would allow the children to work at night legally.</p>
			<p>According to the defendants, Marshall said he would have “the woman who works with me call the labor board and see about the viability of getting waivers” (LaBrecque 13). They assert that Marshall was referring to Associate Producer Kathleen Kennedy.</p>

			<a id="section-01c"></a><h4>FRIDAY, JULY 9th</h4>

			<p>On Friday the 9th, the defendants say, Marshall returned to the offices and informed them that the call had been made, and that unfortunately waivers could only be gotten until “<a href="#section-04n">8:00 or 8:30pm.</a>” However, this being July, it wouldn’t even be dark by “<span class="#section-04n">8:00 or 8:30pm.”</a></p>
			<p>So that the children could work despite the late hour, the co-defendants decided to go ahead with Landis’s plan to hire children which—they say—happened with Marshall’s <em>explicit</em> support.</p>
			<p>Landis testified as follows:</p>

  		<div class="transcript">
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Frank told us that they had called the labour board and the labour board said they would give a waiver but only until eight or eight-thirty, which to our purposes then, our state of mind then, wouldn't accomplish what we needed because it was still light at eight-thirty."</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">James Neal (Landis’s trial attorney):</span> Was any decision made at this time regarding the use of children?"</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Yes.</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Neal:</span> What was that decision, John?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> We decided to break the law. We decided, wrongly, to violate the labor code.</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Neal:</span> John, what was your thinking at that time?"</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> I thought, and we discussed, that we would honor not the letter of the law but the spirit of the law. And I thought, and we discussed, that we would find children whose parents—we would explain to them that we were doing a technical violation, that we were working them without a teacher on the set—explain to them what we were going to do. And if we could find people who would fulfill that function as we thought, and I can only speak for my state of mind then, and I understand that was wrong—but we decided to go ahead and try to find parents who would fulfill that, what I thought would be the spirit of the law, and be the guardians, be there with them on the set.</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Neal:</span> John, that was wrong. You recognize that?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Yes.</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Neal:</span> Out of this meeting or as a result of this meeting, John, was anybody given the task of obtaining the children?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Frank [Marshall] and George [Folsey, Jr.] volunteered to try and find people.</p>
			</div>

			<p>In the end, they say, the task fell to Folsey.</p>
			<p>Folsey later told LaBrecque:</p>

			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>We wouldn’t have hired the kids on a Spielberg picture unless either Spielberg or his people knew it. I mean, that would have been a terrible thing to do, put them in that position. The fact that Frank [Marshall] agreed to do it made me feel that it was okay, that it was really his responsibility, too. (14)</p>
			</div>

			<p>And legally speaking, Folsey was correct—a point confirmed by Allingham’s attorney in 1985. According to standards set by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), the production company was deemed the sole employer of minors and crew members, with liability for their employment and supervision falling squarely on the company’s officers.</p>
			<p>By July 9th, Folsey only had 12 days until the last scheduled day of shooting, July 21st, and scrambled for solutions. </p>
			<p>After the 3rd draft had been typed back in June, Landis ordered his studio-assigned typist (Alpha Campbell) to keep it under lock and key. This created an operational bottleneck as various production personnel attempted to get a copy of the latest draft from the production coordinator (Donna Schuman) who herself was being denied by Campbell. </p>
			<p>Schuman asked Folsey—a family friend—directly about the reason for the secrecy, and he said:</p>

			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>“Because John has written two children into the script. We’re going to have to work them without permits. And we don’t want that information getting out.” (qtd. in F&G, 70)</p>
			</div>

			<p>The conspiracy soon expanded to include a production secretary (Cynthia Nigh); the 1st AD (Elie Cohn); the 2nd AD (Anderson House); and a DGA intern (Hilary Leach, acting mostly as a PA).</p>
			<p>House clocked the violation as soon as he was brought on board and read the script:</p>

			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>“I assumed that there was stage work and that we’d be working with the children on a stage so that the children would not be working after hours—later than 6:30. He [Unit Production Manager Dan Allingham] responded that, no, they were going to be working “night for night.” (Grand jury)</p>
			</div>

			<p>In Leach’s words, “as a member... of the DGA we know the rules, I know the rules, and I knew that we were not following the rules.” (Grand jury)</p>
			<p>However, comprehension of the seriousness of the action they were entering into varied, with many unaware of how Landis actually intended to shoot the scene. Perhaps he had devised a way to do so safely.</p>
			<p>The production coordinator (Donna Schuman) assumed that the children would obviously not be placed in any proximity to the conflagration Landis had been <a href="section-02">hyping-up around the office for weeks.</a></p>

			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>It was always described as a <em>big, huge</em> explosion. John said he was going to blow that village off the face of the earth. You couldn’t put two little kids in the middle of that. (qtd. in F&G, 82)</p>
			</div>

			<p>At Folsey’s request, Schuman even volunteered her husband (Dr. Hal Schuman) as a conduit to LA’s Asian community. He had previously managed a community mental health center predominantly staffed by and serving Asian clientele, and remained friendly with several of the counsellors still working there.</p>

			<a id="section-01d"></a><h4>MONDAY, JULY 12th</h4>

			<p>Dr. Schuman called Dr. Peter Chen. He kept it brief, explaining that his wife worked for Warner Brothers, and that they were looking for two Asian children, a boy and a girl, ages 6 to 8, for a few face close-ups, and to be carried across a river by an actor (Dr. Chen to the NTSB). He was calling to ask if Dr. Chen knew of any suitable families that might be interested in participating.</p>
			<p>(Dr. Schuman may or may not have mentioned special effects and a lack of permitting—on this point Dr. Schuman and Dr. Chen disagreed.)</p>
			<p>Dr. Chen thought about his own 6-year-old niece, Renee, and referred Dr. Schuman to his colleague, Dr. Daniel Le, a former Vietnamese refugee himself, who had two sons, 4-year-old Christopher, and 7-year-old My-ca (“America-Canada,” after the Les asylum nations).</p>
			<p>Dr. Chen relayed the opportunity to his brother and Dr. Le, respectively, who each presented it to their children, who were thrilled by the prospect. Each family confirmed their interest with Dr. Schuman, who then relayed an invitation to visit the set to meet the producers (Landis and Folsey), who would give them more details and answer their questions. The studio would send a van to take them there and back, far across the city, two days later on Friday, July 16th.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Folsey’s search had taken him to an elementary school in a then-predominantly Asian neighborhood (Echo Park) where he was put in touch with an Educational Support Worker, Ms. Julie Hua, and her sister who, between them, had six children and a niece suitable for the roles. They were invited to the set the following night, Thursday, July 15th—the evening before the Chen and Le families were set to arrive.</p>
			<p>Folsey picked up the Hua sisters and their seven children in a limo (Chain 133), and accompanied them across town to Franklin Canyon Park, near to Warner Bros. and Universal Studios. The <em>bona fide</em> Hollywood movie set was buzzing with about a hundred cast, crew, and guests passing through, filming the <a href="section-16b">1954 Alabama KKK timeline</a>. Landis looked over the children, and selected the two smallest ones for the roles.</p>

			<a id="section-01e"></a><h4>FRIDAY, JULY 16th</h4>

			<p>On Friday, July 16th, the Chen and Le families (minus Dr. Le, who was attending a professional workshop) were picked up by a driver in a white van and driven across the city to Franklin Canyon Reservoir for their meeting with Landis and Folsey.</p>
			<p>About 15-20 minutes after the families arrived, Folsey approached, along with John Landis’s mother. Introductions were made, and then, as they waited for Landis to become available, Folsey summarized the sequence.</p>

  		<div class="transcript">
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Hoa-Kim Le (HKL):</span> He showed me who is Vic Morrow, I never met him before. And, "that man is Vic Morrow" and he said, "Vic Morrow walk up in village and he saw only two Vietnamese children, one boy and one girl, and they are the only two survivors in the village and then we pretend like the helicopter come over and shoot at the village. Shoot and bomb the village." And in my mind, I thought he, the village was bombed. Oh, yes, he told me, "The village was bombed, was destroyed and there are only two children, two survivors from the village. So, and then after that, the helicopter was come out, and Vic Morrow just take the children and run across the river."</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Sheriff’s Department (SD):</span> That was after the village was bombed?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">HKL:</span> Right. After the village was bombed. Because the children are the only two survivors in the village after the bomb.</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">SD:</span> This was who telling you this again?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">HKL:</span> George Folsey, the producer, co-producer. That’s why he told me only two survivors in the village. And then, he said "Vic Morrow will walk across the river and we put a little," ah, just like he said, "a little things on the river bed and something — Like a firecracker sound. ... it must be a little scary but it's very safe.”</p>
			</div>

			<p>The Chens remembered it being even shorter.</p>

  		<div class="transcript">
				<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> So as far as you knew, the children were only going [to be] carried across the river?</p>
				<p><span class="transcript-name">Mark Chen:</span> Carried across the river. That’s all. That’s why he said the children didn’t have to speak anything. The actor just carries the two children across the river.</p>
			</div>

			<p>(Only Mrs. Chen also recalled an alternate ending, in which the helicopter lands and picks up Morrow and the children.)</p>
			<p>Folsey maintains that he did tell the families about the explosives, which is consistent with the accounts of the production secretaries (Schuman and Nigh) who overheard Folsey mentioning the explosives in broken English over the phone as he described the scene to prospective parents, although downplaying the pyrotechnical aspect of the sequence as “like watching fireworks.”</p>
			<p>Schuman asked Folsey why he bothered to mention the explosives to the parents if they would not affect the children. “It is the right thing to do,” she quoted him as saying. “When we are going to have explosions on the set, you ought to tell everybody up front. I mean, you know, God forbid anything goes wrong, and then if you tell everybody then you are covered.” (qtd. in LaBrecque, 21)</p>
			<p>Dr. Le admitted, anyway, that he hadn’t paid much attention to the particulars:</p>

			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>I don't know the law. We are the new immigrants into this country. I trust Dr. Schuman and Mr. [Peter] Chen, what they are doing. I do not question them... Folsey appeared to be very honest, nice person and I trust him. And I thought in my mind, because I am ignorant about the movie industry in this country, I thought this may be the way the movie industry working at dealings in this country. (qtd. in LaBrecque, 32)</p>
			</div>

			<p>Finally Landis arrived with Morrow in tow; more introductions were made, and then Landis told Folsey to hire them.</p>
			<p>He broke the news to Mrs. Hua the following day, that her sister’s two children were no longer being considered for the roles.</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>Mr. Folsey said in a very low and sorry voice that our children had not been chosen... He said Mr. Landis had found children younger and smaller. We were very disappointed. (qtd. in F&G, 116)</p>
			</div>

			<p>He’d already promised the Huas some money for their trouble, however, and said he would drop it off that Wednesday evening (July 21st) along with an additional $300, if she and her family could stay on standby until 9:00pm in case the two smaller children couldn’t act.</p>
			
			<a id="section-01f"></a><h4>MONDAY, JULY 19th</h4>
			
			<p>The production migrated to Indian Dunes on Monday, July 19th. </p>
			<p>That evening, according to the 1st AD (Elie Cohn), he, Landis, Folsey, and Allingham had a clandestine meeting to discuss “what day to bring the children, and to make it as short as possible.”</p>
			
			<a id="section-01g"></a><h4>TUESDAY, JULY 20th</h4>

			<p>On the morning of Tuesday, July 20th, a 75-year-old Warner Brothers accountant (Jim Henderling) received a call from Bonne Radford.</p>
			<p>Radford is listed in the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> <span class="section-08">production directory</a> as an “accountant” from the “Warner Bros” faction of the production. Radford is the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0705511/">longtime paymaster/accountant</a> of Amblin Entertainment, and sister of Mary Radford, “Ass’t to Frank Marshall”.</p>
			<p>Pursuant to <a href="#section-01n">the deal memo</a> negotiated between Spielberg, Landis, Marshall, and Warner Bros., all production expenses above $500 needed to be co-signed by two gatekeepers: Henderling, a 75-year-old payroll watchdog on the side of the studio and Marshall, as the Executive Producer, on the side of the two Producer/Directors. </p>
			<p>Henderling told investigators that Radford asked him “how they could hire children without going through the Screen Extra Guild” (Police report).</p>
			<p>He told her that he didn’t know, but would make some inquiries. He called the Screen Extra Guild but remained in the dark. He then mentioned the request to his boss, the Warner Bros VP of Production assigned to the film, Ed Morey, who disapproved.</p>
			<p>But before Henderling could get back to Radford, she called him, explaining that they would not be using children in the end after all, so the point was moot. Instead, she asked if Henderling could co-sign a $2,000 cheque payable to George Folsey, Jr., for a “personal cash advance,” that she would courier to Henderling immediately. </p>
			<p>Henderling said he would ask Morey and call her back. He apprised Morey of the situation and that he suspected the production intended to use the money to hire children illegally. “The whole method seemed unorthodox,” Henderling testified; “I didn’t feel like signing it” (176).</p>
			<p>But <a href="#section-05n">Morey advised him</a> that an Associate Producer had every right to request such an advance, and told Henderling to sign the cheque.</p>
			<p>The cheque, with Henderling’s and Marshall’s signatures on it, became a key piece of evidence linking Twilight Zone Productions, Inc. (as well as the production’s payroll entity, DISC Management Systems, Inc.) to the illegal hiring.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the production had begun shooting the story’s Vietnam sequence, in which Morrow’s character emerges from a tropical swamp before hearing a Viet Cong patrol, and hiding himself behind some reeds. But his rustling is noticed by an U.S. Army patrol, who halt, and wait for him to settle, before spraying the plants with machine gun fire.</p>
			<p>During the production of this scene, Morrow (who’d agreed to do most of his own stunts) was waiting behind the plants for Landis’s signal, at which point he would leap out of the way, and then the special effects team would fire with semi-automatic marble guns. But the pressure was weak, and they weren’t punching through the leaves. The Special Effects Coordinator (Paul Stewart) offered to replace them with squibs (small explosives) but when Landis found out that it would take 15 additional minutes of set-up time on an already packed schedule, Stewart floated the idea of using live ammunition instead, which Landis accepted.</p>

				</a>
			
				<figcaption>Several of the crew were alarmed by the use of live-ammunition on-set on Tuesday, July 20th, 1982, the day before the children arrived. Just moments after Morrow dove out of the way, Landis called “fire!” and five special effects men fired shotguns at the banana plants. (Police report; cf. Chain Ch. 21)</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p></p>

			<p>Many of the crew were startled by the practice at the time, even in the context of a shoot already fraught with technical snags, safety violations, and near-misses, and among Landis’s notoriously rough, ramshackle—<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine?srsltid=AfmBOoqLjwbLZXai6Hwg9OJPd07QeQ6iHkFMwnjnOBEKKooxTF-P5A_7">and loaded</a>—production team.</p>
			<p>Surely Marshall was aware of some or several of these safety incidents?</p>
			<p>According to Chain, in August 1982, Marshall’s lawyers downplayed his involvement to Cal/OSHA, emphasizing the distinction between Spielberg’s group and Landis’s group. They kept separate offices on separate lots. Marshall was dismissed from consideration for indictment on the basis that he had only been on the set during 3 of the 12 days of production, when in fact it had been at least 8 (Ch. 25).</p>

				<figcaption>The production had used a bulldozer to dam the Santa Clara river, flooding it into a lake. Morrow would need to run 100-feet, with one child under each arm, to make it to the opposite shore, where the designated viewing gallery had been set up between the Chapman crane and the bulldozer.</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<p>As of Wednesday, July 21st, the Chen and Le families were still under the impression that their obligation to the filmmakers was only for six hours, 7:00pm-1:00am.</p>
				<p>But the schedule they’d been given was nothing short of highly ambitious: subsequent to their arrival on-set, the production—still bogged down shooting a tracking shot of Morrow walking into the village—required the children to shoot a dramatically significant scene inside the hut. And after that, they still had the full rescue/river-crossing sequence, involving three distinct multi-camera helicopter-and-explosives setups, along with various pick-up shots.</p>
				<p>Both families were bewildered by their being sequestered in a trailer a mile away from the set, near the entrance of the park, and the long delay, well past their originally agreed-upon time-commitment.</p>

				<a id="section-01i"></a><h4>THURSDAY, JULY 22nd</h4>

				<p>The Special Effects Supervisor (Paul Stewart) told LaBrecque, "I knew by one o'clock that we would never finish...

I know what I gotta do and it's not humanly possible." (30)</p>
				<p>Folsey was advised by 1st AD (Elie Cohn) at 2:00am that it would be impossible to complete everything that had been planned for the night.</p>
				<p>Landis testified that, at 4:30am, </p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p>“Elie came to me and said the dolly shot had taken so long and we were behind, and he felt that once we finished the dialogue scene, he recommended that we send the actors home and not rush anything and just go a day over schedule.”</p>

					<p>“I thought it sounded like a good idea and I went to Frank Marshall and George Folsey and we talked about it and agreed to do it.”</p>

That morning Folsey related that they would have to come back at 6:00pm that day 7-22-82 and they would be finished quickly. Folsey handed Dr. Le an envelope with the names “Daniel and Kim” written on it. Inside were five $100.00 bills. There were no receipts or stubs indicating dates or hours worked. Folsey told them not to tell anyone they got paid—just to say, if asked, that they were here to help some friends. [Their driver] then took them home around 7:00am. (DLSE interview with Le family, August 3rd, 1982.)</figcaption>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> You were saying that Mr. Folsey was talking to you about that the children just need to show up by themselves, and that the parents, you and your wife, didn't need to come. Is that correct?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC (Mark Chen):</span> That's correct.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> What was your response to that?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> To be a parent, we really want to be with the children.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> I understand.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> It was the first—the face shoot. It looked very simple. You know, they didn't have to talk, they didn't have to open their mouths. They just looked at the actor, Vic Morrow, that's all.

					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> You mean they didn't say anything about any other shot? They were going to re-take the shot, just taking a picture of the children that evening?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> We hadn't seen the actor carry the children across the river. So we know that would be the next shot. After that, that will be completed. They take so long. He says, "Just come back tonight, and they will try to do it as soon as they can."</p>

				<p>The Chen family knew they were committing to another late night, but had no idea that the roll-over day would be of an entirely different tenor, reserved for the segment’s pyrotechnical and helicopter shots.</p>
				<p>The Le family, however, were under the impression they were going to be finished within an hour or two.</p>
				<p>“<em>The first thing,</em>” Dr. Le reminded her of the exact words Folsey used.</p>
				<p>“<em>The first thing</em> tomorrow when you come back,” Mrs. Le said. They would be paid the same rate, $500, even if they finished early.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Le tried to beg out of it, explaining that although their children had enjoyed the experience, they, the parents, were very tired. Folsey had advised them to nap while they waited, but it hadn’t been so easy—and the next day (today) being Thursday—she and her husband had to go to work, as did Mr. Chen.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">HKL:</span> And well we look at each other and said, “I have to work, my husband has to work, and Mark had to return back to work. We cannot bring the children here.”</p>

I promise with you.” And after he left there, his children were there too. I met his wife and his boy. He is playing the same as my boy so, well, I thought there was no danger, nothing, just like that. The children happy, giggle, laughing. One more day, maybe. I ask my husband, come back with the boy. ....we will pick you up at six o’clock and we finish early, by hour and a half hour, we finish.’ (Le family, NTSB)</p>
				</div>

				<p>In the end, the families acquiesced to their new friends, disorganized but well-meaning American film industry professionals.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, at the same time, the 2nd AD (House) as he was wrapping up, was recognized by one of the eight Fire Safety Officers on set, Jack Tice, who recognized him from a commercial they had worked on together. House couldn’t place him; the FSO reminded him that on that project, he (Tice) had been working on that one in his capacity as a studio teacher/child actors’ welfare worker.</p>
				<p>This was a fateful opportunity, as House had already petitioned Allingham three times and Landis once on the illegality and seriousness of the hiring.</p>
				<p>Tragically, however, when the critical moment arrived, House didn’t tell Tice about the illegal hiring. Instead, he sent a note back to the production office, warning Allingham about a possible fly in the ointment, and hoping he would be the one to call it off.</p>

		<a id="section-01j"></a><h4>12:00pm</h4>

				<p>About six hours later, the crew began arriving back on set.

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Mr. Pittman stated in substance that he is a Teamster truck driver and was performing his duties as driver of the special effects 10-ton truck during the filming of the Landis episode of the "Twilight Zone". Mr. Pittman stated that the afternoon preceding the accident, he arrived on the set at approximately 12:00 o’clock in the afternoon and that prior to arriving at the location, Indian Dunes Park, he had purchased a case of Budweiser beer and soda pop for the special effects crew. He stated that he kept these beverages in a cooler on the back of the 10-ton powder truck. He stated that the 10-ton powder truck was positioned in the area of the Chapman crane and for most of the evening, this is where he spent his time. (Police report)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Meanwhile, back at the office, a production assistant, Carolyn Lee-Epstein testified that she was instructed by Folsey or Allingham to go over to the Burbank Studios and contact Bonne Radford to pick up petty cash which was going to be paid to be paid to the oriental children for their participation in the final scene.</p>
				<p>Lee-Epstein said that Folsey instructed her that “no W-2 forms would be filled out for the children.” (Police report)</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>... Miss Epstein stated that she drove to the Burbank Studios and contacted Bonnie Radford who appeared to be expecting her. She said she picked up petty cash and believed that she had signed for it. She stated that the money was inside a sealed brown envelope.</p>
				</div>

				<p>On Lee-Epstein’s return, she observed the envelope to contain $1,000, an amount she remembered discussing in the days leading up to the transaction, during numerous conversations she overheard about the hiring.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Miss Epstein stated that around the beginning of July 1982, approximately 1800 hours, she was asked by Folsey to drive her to a mechanic's garage in the San Fernando Valley so that Mr. Folsey might pick up his car which was being worked on. Miss Epstein stated that during this drive, a general discussion about the "Twilight Zone" movie was taking place. During this drive, Mr. Folsey asked Carolyn if she knew any Oriental children that "we" can use. Miss Epstein stated that although Mr. Folsey did not refer to the final scene of the movie, she knew that this was what he was referring to. She had read the script. She stated that she didn't understand why Mr. Folsey was asking her if she knew any Oriental children, however, possibly because she was Oriental and maybe had family or friends with Oriental children. She stated that it didn't seem too out of the ordinary at the time. She told Mr. Folsey that she didn't know anyone who had Oriental children, and that Mr. Folsey responded in a nonchalant manner, "Well, we have to be careful about this."</p>
				</div>

				<p>Meanwhile, Allingham got back to House, advising him not to panic, and to tell the Locations Manager (Richard Vane) about Tice. </p>
				<p>Vane said he would keep an eye on Tice’s whereabouts. By the time the DGA trainee (Leach) returned to the set, Landis’s inner circle had developed a new operating protocol.</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Hilary Leach, the Directors’ Guild of America trainee, whose job included escorting the children on the set, was told by House to refer to My-Ca and Renee on her walkie-talkie only as "the Vietnamese," just in case any of the fire safety officers overheard the radio transmissions. (LaBrecque 35)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Dr. Le, Myca, Mrs. Chen, and Renee were picked up by the same white van, traversed Los Angeles, and arrived back on set by about 7:40pm.</p>
				<p>According to Farber & Green, “As they entered the gates of the park, George Folsey turned to Dr. Le. He was relieved to be on private property, Folsey said. The county officials would not be able to get in.” (118)</p>

				<p>The script supervisor (Katherine Wooten) recalled seeing the children in the “9:30 rescue sequence, assuming they were “pretty much put in at the last minute and taken out right away.”</p>
				<p>The helicopter hovered at approximately 60-feet overhead, well above the frame, generating propwash for the scene below. As well, the Unit Production Manager (Allingham) was using it as a platform for <a href="#section-02">the unwieldy (as he had been warned) “Nite-Sun”</a> spotlight the production had rented specially for the segment. He was aiming it out the pilot’s side window (the pilot was flying from the passenger side so that he could keep watch on the nearby cliff face), struggling to keep Morrow centered and in focus; making the hovering helicopter both a technical platform and a dramatic set-piece.</p>
				<p>Morrow approaches Renee and Myca behind a hut—where they’d been placed in wait next to two armed battery-wired explosives—scooped them one under each arm, and then runs out of frame just before the explosions go off.</p>
				<p>100-feet away, across the water, Shyan Chen was startled; her and Dr. Le—today without their spouses—stood beside Folsey as they watched two fireballs roll up the face of the cliff.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> There was one explosion during this period of time. Where was the helicopter?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC (Shyan-Huei Chen):</span> Here.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Over this area, so the helicopter was—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Just right on top of the hut.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> On top of the number 4 hut. Now, one explosion only. Did that surprise you?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> ...were you surprised, Mrs. Chen, when an explosion went off?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> I'm very surprised, because it's too noisy—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Too noisy and your eardrums hurt?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> And the sand.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> The sand was all over.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Yeah, my eyes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> She was scared.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Scared, very scared. Then I saw my daughter was crying.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> Renee was crying at that moment.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Renee had sand in her eyes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> John Landis went over and picked up Renee and held Renee in his arms.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Lawyer:</span> Because she was crying.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Okay. So; Mr. Landis, after your daughter was crying, picked her up, calmed her down, and—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Came to me.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> And then came to you? What did he tell you?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> He didn't say anything. </p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Mrs. Chen was asking Renee to come over to her side, and then she asked Renee whether she was afraid. Renee said yes, she was very scared. Renee's clothes were wet. So Mrs. Chen was afraid Renee might catch a cold, so she took Renee to have her clothes changed. Then Mrs. Chen asked a lady with the pair of glasses [Hilary Leach] whether the filming was all over, and the lady said she did not know. Then she asked Mrs. Chen and Renee to go inside of the trailer and rest there.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Did you complain to Mr. Landis or anyone about the first explosion, the first time you heard it?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> Yeah, I just told George Folsey. He just said no, not dangerous. Everything's okay.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Mrs. Chen says that she did ask George Folsey whether it was going to be dangerous, and George told her that no, it's going to be noisy, but not dangerous.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Lawyer:</span> Let the record reflect that when Mrs. Chen was explaining what Mr. Folsey said, that she put her right hand on her husband's shoulder, and I think that meant that Mr. Folsey touched her on the shoulder and said it's okay. There's no danger.</p>
				</div>

				<p>When Landis was questioned on cross-examination by D’Agostino as to whether he had taken any safety precautions before the stumble, Landis provided as support, his having asked the children whether they could swim, presumably after this, the 9:30pm shot.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Landis:</span> Yes, I asked if the children could swim. One could and one could not.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA (D’Agostino):</span> Why did you need to know at 9:30 if the children could swim?</p>
				</div>

				<p>But she was pursuing another point, and didn’t return to this critical detail.</p>
				<p>If Landis knew one of the children couldn’t swim, because he had been warned about the possibility of drowning, why did he proceed with the shot, after Landis had already seen Morrow drop each child once, by accident, into the water?</p>
				<p>Is it possible the drop was part of the allegedly planned “stumble,” which Landis testified that he improvised with Morrow but did not practice before the 2:20am shot; despite, essentially, having played the scene through during the 9:30pm shot and one run-through for Morrow, Myca, and Renee.</p>
				<p>Dr. Le later testified, as well, that he “had thought that the work was over after the nine-thirty shot and asked if he and his son could go home, but Folsey said, "It's not quite ready yet. We have some other things to do. You need to stay behind. We have some other things to do." (LaBrecque 173)</p>
				<p>Shyan-Huei Chen NTSB interview, cont’d:</p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> After Renee went back into the trailer and changed clothes, did you go out and take another shot, or what were the events after that?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC (translating for SC):</span> By the time they changed Renee's clothes and put her back to sleep, it was about 10 o'clock. About midnight, the heavy-set lady with the walkie-talkie woke them up.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> That would be Hilary Leach?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Hilary Leach, yes. It was break time, lunch break. So she asked Mrs. Chen and Renee whether they wanted to have anything to eat. She said no, we're fine. She left, and after a while, George Folsey came back.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> What did he say?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> George Folsey stopped to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Chen. Let me summarize what he said. If you are approached by a fireman, just mention that you are friends, you are here to help out. Don't mention anything about the money that's been paid. This was the major content of Mr. Folsey's conversation with them.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Now. You arrived at about 7:30.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> At about 9:30, you brought the children out—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> After the first explosion—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> And then brought them back to the trailer, changed their clothes, and put them to sleep in the trailer. You were awakened—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Awakened at about midnight.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> That's where I want to go. Between the time you arrived and midnight, there was only one explosion?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">PC:</span> Yes, according to her memory.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB: Peter Malone (Fire Marshall's Office):</span> May I just ask one thing. How far away was the trailer from where the village was, approximately?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC (Mark Chen):</span> Can I answer that? It's more than a mile.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Oh, is it that far away?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> Right in front of the park.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> That's where Vic Morrow's trailer was at?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">MC:</span> Vic Morrow, actually, even Vic Morrow's trailer is very close by the scene, but ours is far down, by the entrance. You can see the old houses. That's why we didn't know what was going on. [We] were all in the trailer.</p>

				<p>The spectators that night were dazzled by the major 11:30pm helicopter and pyrotechnics spectacle (later classified by the NTSB as a “stunt”).</p>
				<p>The spectators were unaware that during the shot the pilot (Dorcey Wingo)—a Vietnam war veteran, who had never worked a film before, and neglected to walk the set beforehand to learn the location of the explosives—had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startle_response">startle response</a>, and turned to his left, into the village, opening up its flank to the next IED blast, which he had no idea was coming.</p>

"Describing the production of The Exterminator, Stewart said, 'We had a helicopter fly down into the canyon and we had [gasoline] explosions around it. One explosion surrounded the whole tail of the helicopter, so it looked like it was engulfed in flames.” (LaBrecque 12).</figcaption>

				<p>Cynthia Nigh, Folsey’s assistant, recalled Folsey’s words as they watched the 11:30 shot (Grand jury):</p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA (Kesselman):</span> Did Folsey say something as explosions going off.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">CN:</span> Well, he said that he was glad his wife and kids didn’t come, they were going to come.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Did he apart to be surprised or shocked at their magnitude.</p>

					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Before the explosions went off, he didn’t say, “it’s late, I’m glad they didn’t come?”</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">CN:</span> He could have, he said he was waiting for his kids and wife to come.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> First time he said glad wife and kids didn’t come was as these explosions were going off?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">CN:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Matter of common knowledge among many spectators that this last scene was going to be a spectacular series of explosions?</p>

					<p><span class="transcript-name">SC:</span> About 1 o'clock Mrs. Leach and another lady with a pair of glasses took the children and their parents to the scene. At that time Mrs. Chen smelled the gas. They took the children to the scene and then brought the parents back to the other side of the river bank, and at that time Mrs. Chen again asked George Folsey as to whether it's going to be dangerous, and George again said it's going to be noisy but no danger.” (NTSB Chen Family interview July 23rd, 1982)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Le Family: </p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> So, she took children to the trailer next door to get dressed and make up again. They put the old clothes, that were wet, so they put those clothes on. Then they took us by the Jeep to the set, straight to the set. And then I was standing there with George Folsey and a lot of people right at the set to see they get ready for the shooting. And then Rene’s mother, at that moment she was a little bit scared. She was standing near to me. And then George came right over and talked to me and her at the same time. "It may be scary but very safe, don’t worry."</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> What was scary?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> We look at it. The people get ready for the shooting. Rene’s mother had some senses, feeling there may be danger to her daughter. And then George came and reassured me and Rene’s mother...</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> After lunch, when was the next time that Renee then went out for more filming?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr Le:</span> About 1 o’clock. Mrs. Chen and another lady with a pair of glasses took the children and their parents to the scene. At that time Mrs. Chen smelled the gas. They took the children from the scene and then brought the parents back to the other side of the river bank, and at that time Mrs. Chen again asked George Folsey as to whether it’s going to be dangerous, and George again said it’s going to be noisy but no danger.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Note that Dr. Le makes clear Mrs. Chen asked about safety not only after the 9:30 shot, but “again” prior to the 2:00am shot.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> That was at 1 o’clock?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> Yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> What filming took place at one o’clock?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> The scene was to have Vic Morrow carrying the children, crossing across the river.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> At 1 o’clock was going to be the accident flight?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> Yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> Between the time of the accident flight and the last time the children were in the hut, how many times did you see the helicopter?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> She said she saw the helicopter was over the hut once.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> And that was at the 9:30?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">Dr. Le:</span> Yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> At 9:30 you went to the trailer, afterward.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Note that Dr. Le points out that Folsey was asked about danger by Chen on two occasions: after the 9:30 shot, and before the 2:20 shot.</p>
				<p>After being informed of the helicopter’s frightening near miss, around 12:30 or 1:00, Landis led a small group of technicians with waders through the village shoreline, which included one wooden “sampan” boat attached to a long flimsy dock four closed-air huts, and one open-air fish-drying hut. Somehow two IEDs were placed close together, one on the shore, and one under the wooden floor of the fishing hut.</p>
				<p>This is significant because the helicopter pilot directly warned both the director and the Special Effects Coordinator, that there must be no debris whatsoever under his rotors; <a href="#section-06n">and Stewart had told the Fire Marshall there would be no detonations inside any of the huts, per the conditions of their fire permit.</a></p>
				<p>Stewart seemed to suggest the open-air fishing hut didn’t count as a “hut”:</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>When questioned specifically about the small hut in the center of the village, which is tilted and was just east of the sampan, under which a mortar was found by investigators, he [Paul Stewart, Special Effects Supervisor] stated that, "This really was not a hut, it was just a four legged thing with a cheap thatched roof. (Police report)</p>

					<a id="section-01n"></a><figcaption>DOCU2:00.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>At approximately 2:00am, a shot was taken (Camera C), slated “DOCU2:00,” for the sake of Marshall’s intended “The Making Of...” documentary. This shot, apparently documenting technical preparations of some kind, was later used by the defense to support the claim that the fatal scene had been well-planned.</p>
				<p>Shortly before 2:20am, the DGA trainee (Leach) led the kids once again from the makeup trailer to the village, where Landis gave them, and Morrow final remarks, as he prepared for his heroic 100-foot dash through the cold dark waters before them. </p>
				<p>Landis then returned to his spot near Cameras C & F as the helicopter took flight. Standing with him were the first AD Elie Cohn; Jerry Williams; and the propman, Mike Milgrom.</p>
				<p>Milgrom had just finished his last official duty of the night by giving Renee the “broken and naked Barbie doll” prop called for by the 4th draft, to symbolize the successful spiritual transformation of the protagonist, and had been recruited by the SFX Coordinator (Stewart) and an SFX technician (Jerry Williams) to fire a powerful marble gun along Morrow’s path to simulate the helicopter’s guns strafing the water. </p>
				<p>He wasn’t the only crew member operating: one of the truck drivers was also manning a marble gun, the Unit Production Manager, Dan Allingham, was managing the Nite-Sun up in the helicopter, and the Stunt Coordinator, Gary McLarty—who was also Vic Morrow’s stunt double—was firing one of the machine guns full of blanks from the helicopter. </p>
				<p>Williams had wrapped himself in a blanket as protection from the sheets of dust that had stung his eyes during the 11:30 shot. The other SFX technician triggering explosives (James Camomile) standing downriver, was wearing a welder’s mask. He was standing with the SFX Coordinator (Stewart), whose role in the shot was to cue Camomile when it was his turn to fire, and then to radio a third SFX technician (Harry Stewart), further downriver, for his cue to fire two very large mortars near the dam.</p>
				<p>Standing further behind Landis was Production Designer Richard Sawyer. He was proud of the set he’d built. Earlier in the night, “one of the biggest producers in Hollywood” had put his arm around him and welcomed him to the big time (<em>Cursed Films</em>, S01E05). He’d just rebuilt the set, following the disarray of the 11:30pm shot, and lacquered their thatched roofs with liquid cement used as “fire fuel” in preparation for the final shot.</p>
				<p>A director’s guild trainee, Hilary Leach, led the kids from the makeup trailer to the village where Landis gave them and Morrow final remarks. He then returned to his spot near Cameras C & F as the helicopter took flight. Standing with him were the 1st AD (Elie Cohn); SFX technician (Williams); and the prop-master (Mike Milgrom).</p>
				<p>Milgrom had just finished his last work of the night by giving Renee the “broken and naked barbie doll” prop, and had been recruited by Paul Stewart and Williams to fire a semi-automatic marble gun along Morrow’s path to simulate the strafing. He wasn’t the only crew member moonlighting in a different role: one of the SFX truck drivers was also firing a marble gun, the Unit Production Manager, Dan Allingham, was trying to manage the Nite-Sun from outside the left-side helicopter window, and the Stunt Coordinator, Gary McLarty, who was also Vic Morrow’s stunt double, was firing one of the machine guns full of blanks from the helicopter. </p>
				<p>Williams had wrapped himself in a blanket as protection from the sheets of dust that had stung his eyes during the previous shot at 11:30. Camomile, standing downriver, was wearing a welder’s mask. He was standing with Paul Stewart, whose role was to cue Camomile when it was his turn to fire, and to radio Harry Stewart, further downriver for his part of the cue, two very large mortars near the dam.</p>
				<p>Using the large white bullhorn, Landis turned towards the spectators gathered around the crane. </p>
				<p>He was widely witnessed to say something to the effect of “I do not want anybody sitting down, I mean it.”</p>
				<p>The 1st AD (Cohn) told the Grand Jury:</p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p>...He [Landis] turned around and with a bullhorn he asked people not to “to stand up rather than being sitting down. I went to him and I said “why did you say that?” I definitely don’t remember that he said that before. And he said “because of the shock wave of the explosion. It will be easier for people to deal with.”</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA (Kesselman):</span> From that did you infer that he was expecting shock waves?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">EC:</span> Yes.</p>
				</div>

				<p>14 “mortars”—iron pots filled with gunpowder, gasoline, and sawdust—had been dug into the ground. The plan was that once Morrow and the kids were about 15-feet away from the village, the three members of the SFX team would begin triggering their respectively assigned series of explosives.</p>

				<a id="section-02"></a><h3>#02. Extreme negligence</h3>
	
				<p>California Penal Code... </p>
				<p>Homicide... </p>
				<p>Manslaughter...</p>
				<p>...§192. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It is of three kinds:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Voluntary—upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</li>
					<li>Involuntary—in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection. This subdivision shall not apply to acts committed in the driving of a vehicle.</li>
					<li>Vehicular... [prosecuted as a distinct category, owing to its nuances and larger body of precedent].</li>
				</ol>

				<p>This section partially consolidates clear warnings, negligence, and escalation leading to the fatal helicopter crash, supporting the California Penal Code §192 involuntary manslaughter charge.</p>
				<p>Landis and his subordinates conceded that they had hired the children illegally (the unlawful act) but not that their actions met the standard of “gross negligence.” That is, a serious deviation from the standard of care expected from a relevant industry professional (or even citizen layperson) in the same situation.</p>
				<p>The state concedes that although the defendant(s) didn’t intend the harm done, their actions were still of a criminal character. This is because, if the substantial risk of harm was foreseeable (when measured against the actions of a hypothetical reasonable person acting in their place), and yet the defendant(s) proceeded anyway, they either noticed the danger and behaved extremely recklessly in disregarding it; or, if they didn’t notice the danger, should have if not for some prior act(s) of willful ignorance, or carelessness that predictably rendered them unable (anything for alcohol to sloppy procedures). The charge only gets stronger as the defendants admit or can be shown to have been conscious of the danger (approaching, finally, “implied malice”).</p>
				<p>Although one would expect that the basic elements of the scene (explosives, helicopter, night, water work) would make danger obvious, Landis et al claimed ignorance, citing their confidence in their technicians: namely, the Stunt Coordination (Gary McLarty); the SFX Coordinator (Paul Stewart); the pilot (Dorcey Wingo); and six Fire Safety Officers.</p>
				<p>June 16th; June 19th: Marci Liroff (casting agent) warned Landis, Folsey, Allingham, and Marshall about Landis’s stated plans to hire children “off the street.” Liroff said she warned Landis, as well, that the scene “sounds kind of dangerous.” She told Marshall on the phone a few days later about the alarming incident, and he told her he would take care of it. (Police report; Trial testimony).</p>
				<p>June 13th-July 23rd: Donna Schuman (production coordinator), Cynthia Nigh (production secretary), and Katheryn Wooten (script supervisor) reported statements made by Landis and Folsey around their offices.</p>
				<p>Both Schuman and Nigh overheard Folsey talking on the telephone to people they assumed were parents of Myca and Renee. “It is going to be like watching fireworks,” Folsey was heard to say, also explaining that the helicopter and explosions would not be dangerous to the children.</p>
				<p>Schuman asked Folsey why he bothered to mention the explosives to the parents if they would not affect the children. “It is the right thing to do,” she quoted him as saying. “When we are going to have explosions on the set, you ought to tell everybody up front. I mean, you know, God forbid anything goes wrong, and then if you tell everybody then you are covered.” (LaBrecque 21)</p>
				<p>Schuman claims that she asked Folsey at one point what the penalty was for working children without permits. As she recalled the conversation later, Folsey replied to her, <a href="../full/mp4s/d03.mp4">“A slap on the wrist and a little fine—unless they find out about the explosives, and then they’ll throw my butt in jail.”</a> (qtd. in F&G, 76).</p>
				<p>Nigh recalled that following a closed-door meeting, Folsey jokingly said to Landis: “We’ll probably be thrown in jail after this, just because of the kids.”</p>
				<p>Nigh and Schuman also testified that on one occasion Landis went walking down the hallway, and threw his arms in the air, saying (in jest): <a href="../full/mp4s/d08.mp4">“Arrrgghhh, we are all going to jail.”</a></p>
				<p>June-July: Anderson House (2nd AD)</p>
				<p>The 2nd AD was brought on to the production in late June. <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> was the biggest movie he had worked on and he was excited to work on a Landis/Spielberg project. However, he quickly found himself in a bind. </p>
				<p>June 17-19: Immediately after reading the script, House called Allingham and said that he assumed that they would be doing the scenes that read Exterior—Night on a soundstage, but Allingham told him that “No,” they were going to be working “Night for Night.” When Allingham indicated that this was illegal Allingham simply said that they were aware of this.</p>
				<p>June 19-21: Second call. House did some research in the intervening days, and called Allingham again, with some names of “little person” stunt performers/doubles, whom he had worked with previously on another production, who could be used in lieu of real children. Allingham told him the people aren’t small enough. House asked, “why can’t we use dummies?” Allingham told him that usually dummies, when they are carried, do not look sufficiently life-like. He also indicated that he’d already talked to Landis who was insisting on real children. “His indication was vague, but it also seemed to me that it was very clear.” (Grand jury)</p>
				<p>June 20-22: Third call. House urged Allingham to have Landis at least look at the names he’d suggested. Allingham’s response was that the matter was closed, and that the work with children was out of House’s hands and would be someone else’s responsibility. (Grand jury)</p>
				<p>July 15-16: At Franklin Canyon, coming back to the set from a midnight dinner with Allingham and 1st AD (Elie Cohn), with Landis walking just ahead. House once again saw a moment to plead his case. Ostensibly speaking with Cohn, House explained that, the illegal use of children could not only could John Landis lose his ability to work with children in the future, but in fact Warner Bros—the entire studio—could have its license revoked to work with children at all. At this point, Landis turned around and asked House what he had said. House was speechless, but Cohn repeated his statement. Landis only said, “Oh.” (Grand jury)</p>
				<p>July 22nd: After the 9:30 shot—and the second time Morrow had dropped a child in the water—House told Cohn to advise Landis about the drowning risk posed by the water. Cohn told House he’d already talked to Morrow about it, “No problem.” (Chain Ch. 20; cf. Ch. 26. <strong>Liddle testimony?</strong>)</p>
				<p>Late June-July 14: Pilots/Rental Houses</p>
				<p>The Unit Production Manager (Allingham) was tasked with vetting potential helicopter pilots for the segment.</p>
				<p>1st Pilot/Rental House—Clay Wright: Clay Wright had flown stunts for a similar segment in <em>The Exterminator</em> (1980), which was also shot at Indian Dunes, also used SFX Coordinator Paul Stewart, and provided John Landis creative inspiration for the sequence. Bid: $1,200/hour.</p>

				<p>2nd Pilot/Rental House—John Gamble: After hearing the scene described, Gamble told Allingham, “the most dangerous position for a helicopter is to be in a hover.” As well, he asked, “What about all this wood and debris? I doubt if you will crash the helicopter, but you’re certainly going to do severe damage to it.” According to Gamble, Allingham never mentioned to him that there would be children in the scene (Trial testimony).</p>
				<p>3rd Pilot/Rental House—Dick Hart. Allingham told Hart that the Nite-Sun was to be used to shine a light down on Vic and the kids in the dramatic exploding village scene. “Hart happened to have the same Nite-Sun Spielberg used in <em>Close Encounters</em> in the famous shot where the light shines down on Richard Dreyfuss and his car gets lifted up.” (Chain Ch. 4).</p>
				<p>Bid: $900/hour. </p>
				<p>Allingham eventually declined, but returned to rent the Nite-Sun spotlight. Hart advised him that the heavy spotlight was difficult to maneuver, and offered himself as an experienced technician at no additional cost, also declined.</p>
				<p>4th Pilot/Rental House—Dorcey Wingo: </p>
				<p>Experienced Vietnam combat helicopter pilot with no experience flying in films but eager to get into the industry.</p>
				<p>Bid: $800/hour (accepted).</p>
				<p>Disorder and Danger on the Set (July 1st-July 23rd):</p>
				<p>July 5-7th (Universal Backlot): Bob Westmoreland (Makeup Artist) reported an incident in which extras were locked in a railway car when an electrical fire broke out. The director had to be located, and the key found before they could be released. (Chain Ch. 20)</p>
				<p>July 12-16th (Franklin Canyon): Dog trainer (Terry Knapp) stated there was no prior mention of gunfire in the scene involving dogs. Just before filming, Cohn offhandedly mentioned shotguns would be fired overhead. The trainer objected, noting the dogs were gun-shy. Cohn spoke briefly with the director, then insisted they needed the shot. Papineau reluctantly agreed. As expected, the dogs were terrified. She said the gunfire came as a complete surprise. (Police report)</p>
				<p>July 20th (2nd day of shooting): <a href="#section-01g">Live ammunition used on set.</a></p>
				<p>July 21st: Camera C (Ass’t) (Lee Redmond) later told of an incident involving Camera C (John Connor) who was asking Paul Stewart if his camera placement was safe in relation to the upcoming mortar explosions. According to Redmond, before Stewart could answer, Landis testily interrupted and said, “It will be safe and if you don’t want to operate the camera you can go home and I will do it for you.” (Qtd. in LaBrecque, 28)</p>
				<p>Camera B (Steve Lydecker): testified that he expressed concern to Landis that the concussive effect of bombs detonated in front of the cliff could be reflected back over the village. Landis replied (albeit in jest) “well we may lose the helicopter,” and the matter wasn’t raised again.</p>
				<p>July 22nd: <a href="#section-06n">Helicopter crew testimony (11:30 flight).</a></p>
				<p>11:30 — While watching the pyrotechnics spectacle on display, Folsey, Jr., turned to his assistant, Cynthia Nigh, and told her he was glad his wife and kids didn’t come. When asked a couple hours later by Mrs. Chen whether the scene was safe, Folsey kept it brief: “it’s going to be noisy, but no danger.”</p>
				<p>July 23rd: 12:15—exchange in front of crew at the Chapman crane.</p>

				<p><a href="#section-12"> Drug and Alcohol use on set (bits and pieces)</a>: “The bulk of the hard evidence gathered by the detective, however, spoke against the likelihood that drugs or alcohol were a relevant factor. Kesselman calculated that he and Budds devoted more than one thousand investigative hours solely to the issue of drug and alcohol use.” (LaBrecque 92)</p>
				<p>Serious fire permit violations? <a href="#section-15">Chain claims:</a></p>
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>The actual sales records, overlooked for over five years by the police and DA’s investigators, showed that the smallest-sized explosive charges purchased for the fatal scene were 8-oz. charges. Also overlooked was special permit No. 55926 issued by the fire department to Paul Stewart ten days before the crash. It gave him permission to purchase 200 feet of 100 grain prima cord. This amount of “high” explosive was capable of knocking down as many as 70 telephone poles, “like matchsticks,” according to special effects experts. Both of these pieces of evidence ran contrary to all SFX accounts that the highest-powered explosives on the set of the TZ crash were 6-oz. “low” explosives. A “high” explosive far more lethal than the black powder bombs admittedly on the set that night, the prima cord was never mentioned by SFX crew members. (Chain Ch. 29)</p>

				<a id="section-03"></a><h3>#03. Five corporations and nine individuals</h3>

				<p>The Chen lawsuit, seeking $200-million dollars in damages, was filed on August 3rd, 1982, within two weeks of the accident. In the initial confusion, it named a broad swath of defendants. This is typical of litigation involving high-profile incidents, where multiple parties are initially targeted to ensure that all potentially liable entities are included and to avoid missing key contributors to the harm. (LaBrecque 68; Farber and Green 177)</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Bell Helicopters (the helicopter manufacturer)</li>
					<li>The Burbank Lot (the company that leased the land to Warner Bros. studios)</li>
					<li>Newhall Land & Fanning Company (the company that owned and leased Indiana Dunes)</li>
					<li>Warner Brothers Studios</li>
					<li>Western Helicopters (the company that rented out the helicopter and pilot)</li>

				<p>The Le family joined the lawsuit on May 23rd, 1983; “they did not ask a specific dollar amount in damages but Dr. Le said that part of the settlement would be donated to establish a safety department in the name of Myca Le at the film school at the University of Southern California” (renowned film program with graduates including George Lucas, Robert Zemeckis, and Ron Howard).</p>
				<p>The suit was settled on May 7th, 1987, two days before Spielberg’s long-pending deposition was reportedly scheduled to take place (<strong>Source;</strong> Chain Ch. 53). At the time, the defense had put on a strong showing and was giving their closing arguments. The Le family received $2.3 Million dollars and the Chens received $1.7 Million dollars, the difference owing only to legal complexities.</p>
				
				<a id="section-04"></a><h3>#04. Serious threats of blacklisting</h3>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>“D’Agostino wanted desperately for the jury to understand that the fear of blackballing was causing a number of witnesses to temper their testi­mony. Initially, Boren had ruled such testimony inadmissible. He changed his mind after hearing witnesses refer to their job fears: “My previous ruling was in error, and there is a right to ask witnesses about whether or not they have feelings of trepidation because of industry pressure, things like that.” (LaBrecque 181)</p></div>
					<p>
					<div class="blockquote largequote">	
					<p>“Camera operator Steve Lydecker believed in the power of blackballing. He had worked regularly in the movie industry for twenty-two years and believed that his six months of unemployment was due entirely to his outspoken criticism of the production after the crash. His 2:20 A.M. position on the crane across the river from the village had offered the most complete view of the set. “I would say it was probably lack of information and timing that was probably the largest contributor,” he said.” (LaBrecque)</p>
				</div>
				<p></p>
					<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>Some, like <a href="../full/mp4s/d03.mp4">Alpha Campbell</a>, Landis’s typist, complained about being threatened, saying that she’d received anonymous telephone calls during which a male voice warned her that if she said anything unfavorable to Landis, “You are aware you would lose your job” (LaBrecque 181).</p></div>

				<p>Landis was twice witnessed menacing witnesses in plain view of the court.<p>

				<p>The first time, Landis pointed his finger like a gun at witness Gail Rochlenback (a friend of Donna Schuman’s who corroborated her "unless they find out about the explosives" testimony) which was witnessed by Wingo’s lawyer (Eugene Trope), and which prompted a judge conference (156-157).</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>"Yesterday while I was escorting Ms. Rochlenback upstairs in the elevator, she indicated to me that during the break, while she was still sitting on the witness stand, Mr. Landis looks at her and goes like that toward her. Like she was being shot." The detective extended his right hand, as if in the shape of a pistol, index finger straight out, thumb raised, and the remaining fingers closed. "My concern is it's been difficult enough getting these witnesses here, let alone having them put under . . . what I feel is intimidation."</p>
					<p>J. Neal angrily interrupted Budds, saying, “I would like the court to hear from Mr. Landis on that. I mean, I deny that.”</p>
					<p>Boren quickly concluded the gesture was “not in contempt of court at this point, because I did not see it. If, in fact, it occurred, that would be cause for grave consequences.” He then looked up at Neal, and waved him to warn Landis.</p>
					<p>“I wouldn’t even finish the trial if he did something like that, and I’m satisfied that he didn’t,” Neal said.</p>
					<p>What Neal and Landis apparently didn’t know is that Eugene Trope could easily have put the Nashville lawyer to the test on that rash promise.</p>
					<p>“Yes, I saw the gesture,” Trope later told me, characterizing Landis’s finger-pointing as that of “an arrogant individual who seemed to want his own way all the time.” Paul Stewart’s lawyer, Arnold Klein, who had not seen the gesture, said to me of Landis: “Wasn’t that the most pitiful display? Here’s a guy fighting for his life, doesn’t even have the brains to just sit there. That just boggles my mind why he would even do that. He was one hair from going away to state prison.”</p>
				</div>

				<p>A key witness, the casting agent (Marci Liroff) who claimed she warned Landis about the danger presented by the scene, as she walked toward the witness stand, blocked her path with his feet, as witnessed by LaBrecque himself.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>I watched Liroff stop when she saw that Landis impeded her exit. "Excuse me," she said, standing inches away and looking down at the director. Landis continued writing and did not look up. Liroff hesitated only a few seconds before awkwardly stepping over his  legs. Her annoyance was apparent as she concentrated on keeping her balance. She walked briskly out of the courtroom, shaking her head angrily, followed by a glaring stare from Landis, who had looked up as soon as she had passed him. When Neal stood up a few seconds later, Landis quickly pulled his legs back to let him pass. (161)</p>
				</div>

				<p>According to Chain, Liroff said she felt that she had suffered professionally as the result of her testimony. Farber and Green note that “although she had cast several films for Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall before <em>Twilight Zone</em>, she has not worked for them since 1983.”</p>
				
				<a id="section-05"></a><h3>#05. A Grand Jury hearing, a disorienting preliminary hearing, and an appeal gone awry</h3>

				<h4>Grand Jury (May/June 1983): </h4>
				<p>Kesselman conducted a tour-de-force, involving over thirty witnesses, and all five defendants were indicted on all five of the requested counts. <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: The Movie</span> (1983) opened on the same day.</p>

				<h4>Preliminary Hearing (January/February 1984):</h4>
				<p>At this point, the defense had sharpened their “delamination theory” arguing, effectively, that the helicopter’s tail rotor hadn’t been blown off, per se, because the explosives they were using shouldn’t be that powerful, but rather that its skin had “delaminated” under extreme heat. The defense argued that this so-called “delamination” was unique in aviation history and therefore, necessarily, unforeseeable. Although Judge Crahan was skeptical about the delamination argument, he decided to let the three office defendants off the hook for those counts.</p>

				<h4>Appeal Hearing (November 1984)</h4>

				<p>The defense pushed their luck. They gambled on an appeal hearing requesting the case be thrown out altogether. Instead, Judge Ringer <em>re-introduced the two office counts</em> as having been incorrectly dismissed.</p>
				<p>Braun sent two letters to the DA intending to point out the unfairness of prosecuting the office counts when several other high level executives could also be presumed to know about the illegal hiring: why weren’t they being prosecuted? Ergo, those charges should be “disposed of.”</p>
				<p>It was of no use, however, and the case was off to trial.</p>
				<p>In the interim, both Landis’s lead counsel, Harland Braun, and the DA’s prosecutor, Gary Kesselman, were replaced. Braun was demoted in favour of Watergate prosecutor, James Neal, but stayed on as Folsey’s lawyer; and Kesselman was taken off the case shortly after a “taxi dance” club he co-owned was raided by police and found to be employing illegal immigrants. </p>
				<p>As well, Kesselman was not liked by the incoming DA Ira Reiner. Kesselman, still unsure about the significance of the delamination theory, favoured accepting a plea deal offered by the defense: plead guilty but no jail time. Reiner was more bullish: “What the hell, does anyone care whether it is delamination or debris? You’ve got two dead kids. You’ve got a helicopter. You’ve got explosives. What more do you need? ... Landis is going to go to the state prison on this!” (Chain Ch. 40).</p>
				<p>Kesselman was replaced by Lea D’Agostino, who had a successful track record prosecuting career criminals and sex offenders but was inexperienced in the vagaries of “Involuntary.”</p>
				
				<a id="section-06"></a><h3>#06. Missing evidence</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>One of two audio recordings;</li>
					<li>The on-set photographer’s negatives;</li>
					<li>The Executive Producer’s “Making Of...” documentary;</li>
					<li>The fourth draft of the script;</li>
					<li>All graphic and visual materials relating to the film’s production, including several “thumbnail sketches”</li>
				</ol>

				<a id="section-06a"></a><h4>One of two audio recordings</h4>

				<p>The lone recovered audio recording was used as <a href="../full/mp4s/d09.mp4">evidence</a> in the preliminary hearing.</p>
				<p>Two separate audio teams were hired to record the sound for the 2:20am shot. In the chaotic aftermath of the accident, for several days, the footage and sound recordings were withheld by the studio. One of the audio recordings had gone missing. This was of particular significance because, at that time in the case, whether or not Landis was the one to call the helicopter “Lower! Lower! Lower!” and “Fire! Fire! Fire!” through a bullhorn, was a major controversy. </p>
				<p>It was soon overwhelmingly settled, however, that it was indeed Landis who had been calling the action through a bullhorn.</p>

				<a id="section-06b"></a><h4>The on-set photographer’s negatives</h4>

				<p>“On 3-10-86, Sergeant Budds interviewed MORGAN RENARD, via telephone. Mr. Renard stated that he was employed as a Photographer to take still publicity photographs of the <span class="movietitle">"Twilight Zone"</span> movie. Mr. Renard stated that he had taken approximately 108 photographs. Following the fatal crash, Mr. Renard took his three rolls of film with 36 photographs each, to Mr. Robert Friedman, Director of Publicity for Warner Brothers. He stated that he personally handed these three rolls of film to Mr. Friedman.</p>
				<p>On 3-10-86, Sergeant Budds telephoned MR. ROBERT FRIEDMAN at Warner Brothers Studios. Mr. Friedman stated that he will try and locate the above photographs. As of the writing of this report, the photographs had not been located.” (Police report)</p>

				<a id="section-06c"></a><h4>The Executive Producer’s “Making Of...” documentary</h4>

				<p>Marshall had overseen the production of <span class="movietitle">The Making Of Raiders of the Lost Ark</span> and <span class="movietitle"> The Making of Poltergeist</span> both of which had been huge successes on PayPerView and hotel room TV. He was also making <span class="movietitle">The Making of Twilight Zone...</span> but only a single shot was ever released: DOCU2:00.</p>

				<p>Katheryn Wooten (Script Supervisor) to the NTSB:</p>
			<div class="transcript"> NTSB: Do you remember any documentary shots being taken?<p></p>
KW: They were supposed to fire those off when they could. Prior to that shot, I don't know if any of them did or not. They were real bad about letting me know so I could enter it in my journal. I said tell me if you do it but all the time they would do it, and Frank Marshall would run around and say, oh, shoot this real fast, you know. You might say make a doctored shot of this or there is John directing the (Unintelligible). Sometimes they would tell me about them and sometimes they would just, you know, they don’t bother by doing that and so they would just sort of roll it and the cameras would print it, but I don't know if they did any that night or not. I don't know. Nobody told me if they did.<p></p>
NTSB: But in any event under normal shooting, you would be told if they were doing documentaries so you could log it in your journal?<p></p>
KW: Yes, I could log it, but they were just constantly real bad about that, you know, unless I happened to be right there and know they were rolling. Sometimes they would yell out, you know, oh, we just shot, you know, such and such and I'll put a tail plate on it when you want me to call it and I was keeping a log, you know, docu 1, docu 2.</div><p>

				<a id="section-06d"></a><h4>The fourth draft of the script</h4>

				<p>After the third draft was written and Landis set his intention to go about casting it illegally, he ordered his studio-assigned secretary/typist (Alpha Campbell), to keep it under lock and key. Later on, after the disaster, he ordered her to destroy all remaining copies.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d011.jpg">
					<figcaption>Written note on the cover of 3rd draft (detail)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Campbell, however, who was discovered as a witness in March 1983, simply kept them locked away, and was therefore ultimately able to provide investigators with all four of the different drafts. </p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d012.jpg">
					<figcaption>Index, police report (detail).</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>However, Sheriff Budds’ original police report only lists as evidence the third draft, dated 6/13/82, rather than the fourth, dated 6/26/82, suggesting that the fourth draft in particular was never turned over for some reason.</p>

				<a id="section-06e"></a><h4>several “thumbnail sketches”</h4>

				<p>On July 28th, 1982, Landis was grilled by Cal/OSHA and the NTSB during a panel interview.</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>“He was asked whether there were any written plans for the sequence with the helicopter flying and the explosions going off. Cavalierly, the director allowed, “There were lots of thumbnail sketches.” As for blueprints, he couldn’t remember.” (Ch. 16; cf. Ch. 26)</p>
				</div>

				<p>These sketches, however, never turned up.</p>

				<a id="section-06f"></a><h4>All graphic and visual materials relating to the film’s production,</h4>

				<p>With the additional $200,000 budget, especially such a technically involved shot, the scene would certainly need to be planned out in some respect, and indeed designers were hired for the task: Richard Sawyer, Gregory Pickrell, and Tom Stopwell. They worked in Stopwell’s garage.</p>
				<p>Still, when the state requested the defense turn over all visual materials pertaining to the segment, such as scripts, notes, and graphical layouts, they resisted, until ordered to do so by an assistant US attorney on behalf of the NTSB, and only turned over a single drawing.</p>
		
				<a id="section-07"></a><h3>#07. “the spotting plan”</h3>
				<p>The spotting plan looked very much like a top-down diagram of the set.</p>
				<p>Remarkably, it included an object labelled helicopter “crashed.”</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d013.jpg">

				<p>Budds had been puzzled by the image.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>It depicted the Vietnamese village with a crashed helicopter (tail missing) and was located approximately 20 feet from the actual crash position. He took the graphic drawing to the Sheriff’s Photo Lab where it was photographed.</p>

				<p>Later, he inquired with the production Illustrator.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Gregory Pickrell,</p>
					<p>Mr Pickerel stated that he was one of the artists for the Landis episode of The Twilight Zone. He stated he was the individual who had drawn the graphic which depicted the crashed helicopter in the final scene of the Landis episode.</p>
					<p>He stated that he put a crashed helicopter into this artist’s conception because following his research about Vietnamese villages he thought it would add authenticity. He concluded that this concept was solely his idea and that he had suggested to his boss Richard Sawyer that a crashed helicopter be considered for this scene but he had not heard any more about it.

					<p>Hired Greg Pickerell to do some artists renditions of village—his job is a set designer who lays out the plans of the sets. Says he had a four week prep to do the show. Got sketch in June. It shows a downed helicopter, a crashed helicopter, in about position it really happened, without rear rotor. </p>
					<p>To clarify, Kesselman asks him questions about Landis— he says Landis never said he wanted downed helicopter in sketches and never mentioned that there would be be crashed helicopter at Indian Dunes.</p>
					<p>Pickerel knew of helicopter in basement of Paramount and he said “gee, you know it would be a great idea, since we are showing a village under attack, why don’t we have a helicopter in the water?”</p>
					<p>Sawyer says he told Pickerel that he didn’t think it would work but to finish drawings and they would get back to him.</p>
					<p>Pickerell said it was a result of his own research that he put helicopter that way.</p>
					<p>DA: "As far as you know this is strictly an ungodly coincidence?”</p>
					<p>Pickerell: "Yes."</p>

				</figure>

				<p>At the 46th Academy Awards, <span class="movietitle">The Sting</span> (1973) celebrated a monster year. They’d been a surprise hit at the box office, stealing <span class="movietitle">The Exorcist</span>’s thunder by opening faster and wider. Then, the word of mouth made the movie into an experience, and had friends and families coming back all summer long.</p>
				<p><a href="../full/mp4s/d10.mp4">Julia Phillips</a> became the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Picture until Wendy Finerman became the second in 1994, with <span class="movietitle">Forrest Gump</span>.</p>

					<figcaption>Speech: “You can imagine what a trip this is for a Jewish girl from Greatneck. Tonight I get to win an Academy Award and meet Elizabeth Taylor all in one moment. Thank you so much!”</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>She would go on to produce—alongside her ex-husband, Michael Phillips—<span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span> and <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, two of the defining movies of the late 70s. While her ex took the lead on <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span>, Phillips took the lead on <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>.</p>
				<p>At the same time, since approx. 1973, she was maintaining an escalating cocaine addiction, which peaked in approx. 1978-79 as a freebase addiction. She eventually went through a successful rehab process, and began working again in approx. 1981, with a new development deal at MGM.</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p><a href="../full/mp4s/d11.mp4">“I had started using cocaine and amphetamines way before the success. And in fact had had quite a bit of success working behind them. [...] There was a definite progression that went from using it as a tool, to using it as a crutch, and then you weren’t using it for anything except that it was life itself.”</a></p>
				</div>

				<p>Her relationship with Spielberg was never the same, and the two went from close friends to cordial strangers in a matter of years, without even a single discussion, note, or Get Well Soon in-between.</p>
				<p>In 1991, Phillips, with the encouragement of her friend and fellow writer, author Anne Rice, finished her first novel, <span class="booktitle">You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again</span>, which went on to be a New York Times Bestseller, and to sustain a lingering cultural relevance.</p>
				<p>Spielberg is one of the story’s main characters, who travels with the protagonist along the story’s central arc. On September 13, 1977, at the tail end of post production for <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, in the midst of a merchandising rights renegotiation with a beleaguered and nearly bankrupt studio, Phillips is banned from the Columbia lot, which quickly becomes a gossip column headline and an embarrassment to the production, before descending further into—and eventually escaping—her addiction, to write her own book about her own experiences.</p>
				<p>In truth, Spielberg was justifiably upset she’d been shopping around <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>’ product reel without his permission; the special effects on this thing were insane, basically the sequel to <span class="movietitle">2001</span>, a generational bliss-op, a “cottage industry” of raw merchandising potential.</p>
				<p>“Just wait until you see the E.T..”</p>
				<p>She felt she had to do it to keep the money flowing. People were about to get in trouble for stock manipulation. David Begelman, Phillip’s friend and Columbia Pictures Studio Head, was about to get disgraced in an embezzlement scandal that would or should all but destroy the studio’s reputation. It was going to get ugly one way or another.</p>
				<p>Hey, business is business. “Don’t get mad,” one of her career rivals had once told her, after she’d (gently) played him for leverage in a contract negotiation, “get even.” And he’d been there that day too, Dan Melnick.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>I am a spotter of trends: the drug paranoia underlying the movie [<span class="movietitle">Easy Rider</span>] is rampant in the alternative culture that has sprouted. It amazes me that this is not obvious to the people releasing the picture. (90)</p> </div>

				<div class="blockquote largequote"><p>And so, with little money in our pockets, we start to organize weekend-long soirees. People have such a good time, and are so impressed with who they meet, they bring more interesting people the next week. These enterprises grow and grow and it is possible to see Robert Redford and Liza Minnelli, the veteran famous, along with Brian De Palma, Marty Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg, unheralded and barely known, drinking wine, eating steak, walking on the beach. A rare mixture of haves and have-nots.</p>
				<p>Plus there is a fascinating beach community: the Dunnes, the Moores, Katherine Ross and Conrad Hall, Lee Grant and Joey Feury... And always, always, talk—grandiose talk—about movies, about the state of movies and how much better they will be when we make them.</p>

				<p>SCENE FROM A MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE:</p>
				<p>ovo: I am standing on a chair, having a face-to-face over a glass of wine with Michael Crichton one afternoon at Margot and Jennifer’s, early seventies. He and Paul Lazarus are making a movie called <span class="movietitle">Westworld</span> over at MGM with Dan Melnick.</p>
				<p>HANDHELD CAMERA CIRCLES<br>AND WEAVES THROUGH YOUNG HOLLYWOOD:</p>
				<p>Scorsese, Dreyfuss, Milius, Spielberg, Schrader, etc. A rogues’ gallery of nerds. There is not a single guy here I would have dated in high school or college. Outside of Michael Phillips.</p>
				<p>Michael Phillips and Michael Crichton know each other from Roslyn. They used to do the circle jerk as Cub Scouts together. Male bonding. It is amazing how many people from Great Neck and Roslyn there are trying to make their way in show biz. A number of them do... (123)</p></div>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">		
				<p>In this case: theaters, how wide the release, how much money for a network buy. <span class="movietitle">The Sting</span> is coming out right in the middle of a marketing revolution. Up until <span class="movietitle">The Godfather</span>, every time you had a picture you thought was going to have reviews and audience appeal, you let it out slowly in a handful of chichi theaters in the major cities, and let it build. Then you went in ever widening waves. But Frank Yablans had released <span class="movietitle">The Godfather</span>, and then <span class="movietitle">Love Story</span>, as if they were two-week actioners, and now everyone was figuring out that a quality picture could really rake in the dough. Fast and long. Not one or the other.</p>
				<p>The revolution has not yet occurred at Universal, which at this point in its career has not decided if it is in the movie business or not. It is definitely in the TV business, but not too many people there are in the movie business. There are George Roy Hill and Steven Spielberg, and Sid Sheinberg and Ned Tanen. Outside of them, nobody at Universal knows that there is a marketing revolution going on.</p>
				<p>By the time they release <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> for Steven, they will know it and go with a thousand theaters. But just now, they are going with about thirty-five in key markets, and I am checking out with Lederer and Leo, who together form a pretty dynamic marketing duo for Warners, if I should take a stand or not. I have made myself learn a lot about this part of picture-making on <span class="movietitle">Steelyard Blues</span>, and I figure I should apply it to <span class="movietitle">The Sting</span>.

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>I don’t know what he means by it,” I lie, “but Steven says he wants to do a movie about UFOs and Watergate, and I want to do it with him.” I am leaning on the edge of Begelman’s desk, because when you are in his office, it is best to stand. He likes to keep the heat up and the Muzak just at the edge of your consciousness. He likes the vibe soporific. He likes to keep the meetings short and docile.</p>
				<p>I like to walk around anyway. It helps me to keep my naturally circuitous thinking patterns linear. I make more points walking, and I slamdunk on the sudden stop or the lean against the desk. Begelman stands up; now he is taller than me again.</p>
				<p>“I’m in,” he says. “Let’s go.” Lies work. Just sweep him along on pure excitement.</p>
				<p>How am I to explain to D.B. that anyone who has ever dropped acid and looked up at the sky for a while or smoked a joint and watched the Watergate hearings on TV is waiting for this movie? And that it is uniquely this group of people who is going to give it to them? Hubris and youth and the promise of really good drugs fire these ambitions. There is no question in my mind that this group—weak as we are on story and screenplay—can pull it off. It will be like building a city. (139)</p></div class="blockquote largequote">

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>...Steven and Michael and me wait in the holding area outside Begelman’s office. We wait for Begelman, but more to the point, we wait for Guy McElwaine, a star agent at ICM. He represents Steven, so he is going to represent all of us on <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>. We offered to do that to guarantee Steven staying in the project. Steven was hanging out with men who were too old for him. Who bet and drank and watched football games on Sunday. Who ran studios and agencies. [...]</p>
				<p>We got Steven outta Guy’s house in the Bev Hills flats, and on to the beach, where people were still discussing art and greatness, and were occasionally smoking a joint. Where the ambient sound was rock ’n’ roll, and the house wasn’t so decorated that even the inhabitants felt like guests. Steven was the most talented contemporary we knew. He and Michael had become friendly while we were at Universal and we’d seen some dailies of <em>Sugarland Express</em>. We wanted to guarantee his staying in, and Guy and ICM hitting us seemed reasonable. (140)</p></div>

				<p>I have Columbia spending constantly. On tests, on more assistants, on one under-the-table rewrite after another. The Beges has agreed not to read Schrader’s first draft, called <span class="booktitle">Kingdom Come</span>, because I told him it would make him not want to make the movie. Certainly it was not a screenplay that Steven wanted to direct, although it very much created the Roy Neary character, a man obsessed by something way beyond his intellectual but within his visceral comprehension. (184)</p></div>
<p>
	<div class="blockquote largequote">

				<p>Michael has made it clear he ain’t doin’ it; he’s planning to go around the world in search of the soul he doesn’t have. Originally Verna Fields, who edited <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, was going to be associate producer, but then Steven started to resent all the credit she was giving herself for its success and asked me to kill her off.</p>
				<p>Which, to be honest, was fine with me, because I hadn’t liked her from the start. She was my mother: angry, bitter, middle-aged, frustrated. Mad at all the kids having their big shots. Being the Big Shots. Once she and I were invited to speak to a convention of Eastman Kodak types in Rochester, New York. I had just done one of those silly commercials for them that appeared in all the <span class="booktitle">Film Digest</span> magazines. I had mentioned her in the body of the copy and Steven had cut her out and said, Come up with another woman. I had put Marcia Lucas’s name instead. (188)</p></div>

				<p>
					<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>Maybe you’ll be executive producer on <span class="movietitle">Fear of Flying</span>... tell the Beges you’ll take it over if I fuck it up...” Steven nods, yes, maybe, as long as I understand <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> comes first. My life on hold, my dreams on hold...</p>
				<p>“All great movies are the product of one person’s <em>obsession,</em>” he keeps telling me. My <em>obsession,</em> his film. Not a very good deal. But I’m not into deals. I am into one step in front of the other, up the ladder, don’t get stuck, stuck here on the ladder of my life... (189)</p></div>

					<div class="blockquote largequote">
				<p>Basically, though, I am here with David Begelman’s money babysitting Steven while <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> opens in New York. I have worked long and hard keeping Steven’s interest in the project. Today he has gone around the City in a cab with Albert Brooks taking home movies of the lines of people waiting to get in to the theaters. The boyish joy and pleasure he expresses make me, a natural cynic, feel more hopeful. He is so blatant in his excitement for himself that he is adorable. I do not notice for at least a year that this kind of behavior bespeaks a childish self-preoccupation that tends to remove all hope. In the end. Because cynics are hopeless romantics, and they get more disappointed. (196)</p></div>

				<p>I am going to New York for some precasting sessions with Richard and Steven. We all agree, even Michael, that I should bring our still unapproved workprint of <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span> to New York and show it to a couple of critics. These guys have all been cultivating Pauline Kael, whom I have met at least five times and who never recognizes me. (224)</p></div>

				<p>Grady doesn’t think twenty-five grand is enough money to sit in Francis’s suite with Steven and learn how to write movies. He complains about the money constantly. I keep him provided with blow, to take his mind off the money, and he complains about that too. He has actually managed to make me feel like a failure getting him only twenty-five. He should know what it was like getting twenty-five for him from Stanley Jaffe.

				<p>When I first asked Stanley for the money he dismissed the request and told me that friends did rewrites for free. I tried to explain that Grady was a friend, but he was also from television, and was routinely paid fifteen hundred bucks just to watch someone else’s run-through and write a couple of jokes. I tried working it out with Stanley, teasing cajoling flirting but he was resistant. I kept telling him that this was who Steven wanted and we had already gone through a number of writers for free. We had gone through some writers for money, too. The best ideas were freebies from other film-maker types we were hanging out with. Brian De Palma came up with the implantation of the mountain. I never really knew whose idea was what, not even my own anymore. Steven would call at night sometimes, and chat about ideas. With <span class="movietitle">Tubular Bells</span> playing in the background. I never knew if they were his ideas, or Barwood and Robbins’. (226)</p></div>

				<p>(On Francois Truffaut, whom they’d cast as one of the leads in <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>:)</p>
				<p>“Steven, I’m telling you that left-ear shit is as authentic as the gimp.” A couple of sentences per day were devoted to this subject.</p>
				<p>“He’s deaf,” Steven argued. “He makes me repeat everything several times, even with Sally translating.” It didn’t occur to Steven that he was being pimped. People as manipulative as Steven never think that they could be just players in other people’s mind games.</p>
				<p>“Making you repeat stuff could be any number of things,” I pushed. “He could be trying to understand his part, which is the nice interpretation. Or he could be pulling a power play. Making you repeat yourself too many times for you to be the boss.” Silence. It was either too easy or too hard to get Steven Spielberg’s attention. That’s why he was such a great director: for him it had to be perfect small moments between people or Barnum & Bailey. Lots of directors were doing small moments but no one was doing the circus quite so well. </p>
				<p>Halfway through dinner I whispered “François” and he turned minutely in my direction. Of course, Steven argued that it was an inconclusive gesture, and he welched on the bet. I know I won because it earned me François’s eternal enmity.</p>
				<p>When the dinner was over and we had all said our goodnights, we got back into Steven’s car. We sat in silence for a moment while the car warmed up. We turned to each other. For no particular reason, I put my arms around his neck and stuck my tongue in his mouth. We had a good long kiss. He pulled away. His glasses were tilted at a ridiculous angle; he looked frightened.</p>
				<p>“Jul-ee-a, that was a real kiss...” Treasure it, pal, it’s the one and only. More silence during the drive to Burbank and I patted his hand in a comforting gesture before I got out of his car and into mine.</p>

				<p>The test had been sitting in the projection booth all day, but I was so busy I was forty-five minutes late on everything and long overdue for a bathroom visit. If I didn’t see it right away, though,  Steven would think I didn’t care. And if I didn’t care enough he might commit to another picture. I had once written in lipstick on his bathroom mirror, “Stop me before I make another deal,” and he’d laughed but he continued to read scripts. It created underlying pressure at all times and it gave me a big headache every night at about six thirty. (245)</p>

	<p>Steven laughed. Best defense with me . . . So we drove off to dinner together in Steven’s rattly little Mercedes 280, which meant we’d have to drive back after to Burbank to get my car.

I can scream <em>Slow down</em> in his ear, and hope he will listen. I do, after all, as they like to say, have his ear.

				<p>Steven insists we resist the urge to sleep. He says it is the only way we will turn around Over There. Since he is far more traveled, having gone around the world with each new opening of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> the previous summer and fall, I decide to go his way. Besides, he needs a playmate, and that is me. Has been for a couple of years, now. His wish is pretty much my command. So we dump our bags at the Dorchester and hop back in our car. The driver takes us to Windsor Castle, and then, because it is so cold, to the actual mile-square old city of London.</p>
				<p>“They put the heads of their enemies on stakes outside the city as an example,” he says, as we step out of the car near the gate. I stop at a headstone.

				<p>“Most fearfully <em>betrayed</em>...” I say, and he smiles. The winds are really whipping around us now, so we get back in the car. “Is it teatime yet?” I ask. I want to taste a scone and rid myself of an embryonic FFA, with its aura of a migraine coming on.(315-16)</p></div>

But it is good to show up for these pretentious gatherings. Besides, Jodie Foster wins...</p>
				<p>Steven escorts me to the Academy Awards. We sit right in the front row. When Warren presents the Best Picture award, he winks at us. The next day, hustling Amy, he tells her that Steven and I looked cozy together. Uh oh. More trouble. But it’s good to show up for these dos. (330)</p>

				<p>I am looking at the credits on the back of the album jacket while I am chatting with Steven one day. We are in postproduction on <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> and people are starting to figure out that it might really be something. Steven has insisted on total secrecy from the start: closed set, closed dailies, locked doors whenever possible. We are still cloaked in secrecy, but it is hard to have that many people in your employ trying to do that many things that have never been done before without being visible.</p>
				<p>Plus, he and I have made it a point to show up for certain things: David Begelman’s wedding to Gladyce, held at Ray Stark’s pad, out on the lawn among the Moore sculptures; the Oscars, the Golden Globes, etc., not to mention our posts at Ma Maison, La Scala, and the Imperial Gardens. You run into pretty much everybody in town that way.</p>
				<p>The problem with showing up at these events with Steven is Amy. She didn’t like us going to the Oscars and the Golden Globes together on all those <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span> nominations. I would’ve been happy to take someone else, but Steven and I are tight as can be, and it makes good business sense to show up together. [...]</p>
				<p>When Dick Sylbert expressed a desire to meet Steven, I arranged a dinner as a foursome. Maybe Amy wouldn’t get pissed off that way, I figured. We dine at Dominick’s and I’m the last one there. Steven’s mouth twitches with annoyance. At some point the guys get it on, and Amy and I repair to the bathroom. I pee; she fucks with her hair. She pees; I fuck with my hair. Wash hands. Good little girls. Share a secret—well, maybe two. Bad little girls. And I think, Well, now we share secrets, we’re pals. Fat chance. Every time Amy is afraid she’s losing Steven, she opts for a tearful confession. Bad enough to blow your cover, bitch, tacky to blow mine... I think she’s retaliating for the Oscars and the Golden Globes.</p>
				<p>Steven starts to complain about her... he’s nervous that he’s let her move into the house, the house I told him to buy...</p>
				<p>“Maybe you should talk to her, Ju-lee-a,” he stutters. Steven stutters a lot. He also repeats whatever you just said to him back to you. It reminds me of my father, when he had his clinical depression. In the beginning of our mission to make <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, these personality traits seemed endearing, now they bore me. And I know he is at the end of his rope on my drugs and lateness. Still we’re tight enough for him to imply that it would be a nice procedural gesture on my part to move her out of his house. I laugh in his face. In your earhole, man.</p>
				<p>“Are you suggesting...” He interrupts me with laughter. Best defense with me.</p>
				<p>“Forget it..." (332-333)</p>

				<p>I have gotten Steven a great deal of money to shoot the ET. Columbia, and all the bankers and the Herbie Allens, and Alan Hirschfields and Joe Fischers and David Begelmans, etc., have gone down the whole road with us. Not always happily, sometimes reluctantly, but they have stuck with us. And they haven’t seen dick. And they aren’t going to for quite some time, because we need the extraterrestrial to find focus for the “experience,” as Verna Fields once dubbed it. For the last twenty, maybe even thirty, minutes of the movie.</p>
				<p>Every time I walk on the set, Michael is working one of the controls for the ET. He is desperately searching for a role to play on the picture, now that he’s back from his soulsearch and has an inkling of what <em>Close Encounters</em> is. I think he looks ridiculous and I am unbeatable. I am wrong.</p>
				<p>At the end of two weeks, I have to force Steven to wrap the ET, or we’ll never get the amount of time he wants on the dubbing stage. We have a fight instead of a party. Clark Paylow calls me later to tell me that he and Michael have told Steven he can keep shooting and Steven has said, “Julia says I can’t shoot anymore. Without Julia there would be no <em>Close Encounters</em>...” I guess Clark is telling me this story to make me feel better. I am at the point where nothing makes me feel better.</p>
				<p>Michael and I have gone to a screening and gotten into a fight before the film starts to roll. As the lights go down he says, under his breath so Mike Kahn won’t hear, “I hate you.” Tears shoot out of my eyes and I split. I go into a three-sixty spin at the corner of Schuyler and scare myself half to death. Steven calls, enraged, about my leaving the screening and I tell him the story. They run the picture for me the next day but I know I am not forgiven... (335)</p>

<div class="blockquote largequote">

				<p>I’ve been waiting to see that shot all my life,” Steven says, pleased. “And I got it for you. We have a great deal of the footage for the end of the movie, and we have reached the point where it is smarter to put it together and then see what effects we need, than to create the effects and then cut them together. I don’t want to waste any of the money that is getting harder and harder to squeeze out of Columbia.</p>
				<p>One day Steven calls from the editing room at the Marina and tells me to drop everything and get over there. The only other time he has ever done that was with the discovery of Cary Guffy, so I drop everything.</p>
				<p>... The entire third act of the movie—the experience—flows before me. All that disparate footage, pulled together. Even without a good percentage of the effects it is coherent, beautiful, uplifting... they’ve nailed it! Hugs and kisses all around. I depart elated. I think I am one of maybe three people who knows how huge this picture is...” [...]</p>
				<p>“I want to talk about the opening credits,” Steven says. He has already made me pressure every writer who made a contribution to the script. When the Writers’ Guild insists on an arbitration, I get Schrader and Grady to back off their right to credits. When his lawyer, Bruce Ramer, a nice guy who wants to stay that way, also backs off from the issue, Norman and I step into the breach. Steven is going to get a “written and directed by” credit, compliments of us. Now he wants to make sure it’s in front. I do some fast thinking.</p>
				<p>“So that means our production credit is in front, too?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, how do you want it?”</p>
				<p>“A Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips Production, same height, same width, first after you at the end as well,” I say, although I have never thought about credits before now. I pat myself on the back for my business acumen... I will get to pay some heavy dues for this credit...</p>
				<p>“Agreed,” he says, faster than a speeding bullet. <em>Now, your brother</em>, yadda yadda yadda... (337)</p>

				<p>I tell Melnick I want to go to New York to see my mother. He says if I let Steven go to the desert with no one but Clark he will come back wanting two thousand extras and four hundred fifty stallions. I let the remark go right to my ego and cancel my New York trip. We go to Lake Mirage. The desert is in bloom, plus I have been imbibing some evil reconstituted Miami shit and I get a violent case of the sneezes. I know it pisses Steven off, but between sneezes I am still nailing the particulars down for him and anticipating his needs.</p>
				<p>When we drive back through the desert, night falls in front of our eyes, first wrapping the hills in a purple blue. And then thousands of stars, crisp, clear, not like in L.A., blaze in the midnight-blue sky and the hills are black against it, and we both remember what we’re trying to do with this picture and we’re friends again...

				<p>Steven calls later to complain about me yelling out effects in the screening. Great. Now Mike Kahn is a spy. It’s reached the point that I don’t know who is an adversary when there are too many elements in the room.</p>
				<p>“Well, how else you want me to get the money for it,” I explode. “I even made up some extra ones, for the overages that will surely occur...” The things that happen...</p>
				<p>He backs off. Later that day, going over some ADR requirements with Kendall, whom I have put in charge, Steven says, “Just tell her I know she’s calling me L.P. for Little Putz, not Little Prince...”</p>
				<p>I don’t hear from anyone I need to hear from for two days. Then Melnick calls. “Well, I got you the money,” he says...</p>
				<p>“Thank you-u-u,” I ooze through clenched teeth. I. Got. You. The. Money!@#? Then why didn’t <em>you</em> run the picture for Herbie Allen while I visited my cancer-ridden mother in New York?!@#</p>
				<p>I get off the phone and feed my anger with more blow. I have taken to storing it in plain sight, hanging from a Baggie in the middle of the bulletin board. Coke Theater.</p>
				<p>Now the plan is to shoot in the desert in May, come back and shoot the ET and any inserts we need. It is a year since we started principal photography at Devil’s Tower. I convince my parents they should come out here. My mother has responded well to chemotherapy and is in remission. Remission, a friend of mine says: a word that should be outlawed.</p>
				<p>I have to start pushing on campaign three: release, marketing, renegotiating.</p>
				<p>The whole conception of the release is a holdover from the days when the picture was opening Easter. Now that it has settled in at Christmas, I feel I need to go over everything again. I actually make a team of copies of the charts and maps and dates on the kind of cardboard Kate uses for her school projects.</p>
				<p>Steven and I have a marketing meeting late one night with Melnick and Begelman. I bring my visual aids and rest them on the corner of Begelman’s desk. I walk them through the plan: Magazine covers starting in early November. November release in New York and L.A., November 17, a concession to Norman Levy’s requirements, which seem mainly to be that he promised the picture to the Walter Reade Organization. Record release at the same time, so that it can be climbing the charts in time for a wider release before Christmas.</p>
				<p>We go over and over it. Norman wants the picture wider in November. It is a dead time of year between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We’ll take the New York and L.A. release, that’s it. I do most of the talking, and I have made a point of no drugs for the day. I maintain a calm veneer, no matter how many times I have to go over the same speech. They all know I have no patience. I think they are making me reiterate for their amusement. I don’t care. I’m on a mission.</p>
				<p>It is a very long meeting. They say they will think about it, but when Steven and I leave the building, I’m pretty sure they’re convinced. I am nothing if not convincing. Particularly when I’m on a mission. It is cold and dark outside and we huddle on the steps together, just to get our bearings. He hugs me, starts to say something, but I blurt his words before he gets to say them.</p>

				<p>I wake up sweating from leftover flu and a nightmare. When I bolt out of bed, I upset a mirror with at least a gram of coke spread out from last night. Jack is in the corner flagellating himself with the cords from my blinds. This is a morning ritual with him. At first, it was just another wacky, hilarious thing about Jack; now it is getting to be a satire of the thing itself, like Rod Steiger’s acting.</p>
				<p>“This is going to be a very bad day,” I say.</p>
				<p>It is September 13, 1977.</p>
				<p>It is the worst day of my life.</p>
				<p>I check in with Kendall. “You'd better get over to Todd-AO,” she says. “Steven's been on the phone all morning with Dan Melnick...”</p>
				<p>Nauseated, I throw myself into an ungratifying two-minute shower. No time for negative ions today. I dress quickly: Maxfield top, black Brioni pantsuit, mascara, lip gloss, gram of coke. I take off in the limo that has been provided for the last week, I’m on such a tight schedule and I’m such a bad driver. Jack comes along for the ride.</p>
				<p>I meet Norman at the dubbing stage. I go in to talk to Steven. He sees Jack and his mouth twitches.</p>
				<p>“I'm going to this meeting this afternoon,” he declares. Uh-oh. I wanna see the Beges alone...</p>
				<p>“Steven, I don’t think that’s a good idea...”</p>
				<p>“I’m just gonna go and listen to everyone...”</p>
				<p>“Steven, I’m asking you, please, don't go...”</p>
				<p>“I’m going...” <em>Here lies Sir Rupert...</em></p>
				<p>“You know, you may be a great director, but you're a lousy businessman,” I say, feeling earth going to dust beneath my feet. I didn’t mean that.</p>
				<p>We go to the Burbank lot. There is a message from Connie that Steven, Melnick, and Norman Levy will all be joining us. I haven’t a clue who’s been cast as First and Second, but I know I get to be the Third Man Through the Door. Fuck them! I instruct Norman to go over instead, tell them I won’t attend a stacked meeting. Unless they want to close the renegotiation first. Never give up the product, Jack has reminded relentlessly, until you get the money. I wait in my office for a call from him. They need me...</p>
				<p>They tell him that I can “retreat to the standard position of producer” or walk. He calls and tells me this news. I am stunned. There’s been nothing standard about this producing gig so far. Why start now?</p>
				<p>I know I should stand up for myself. Go to the meeting, beard the lions in their den. But the coke, which has amplified my courage for so long, turns on me and makes me weepy. I have overplayed my hand and I have lost.</p>
				<p>I know that I am being betrayed by the only partners who have mattered: Michael. Steven. Begelman... <em>most fearfully betrayed</em>...</p>
				<p>I call Michael at Todd-AO, where he’s been hanging out. I tell him he’s got it all, I’m going home. He worries out loud that we might be sued.</p>
				<p>I mention to him he might want to pursue the Artie Mogul offer. When he does, Artie denies ever having made it.</p>
				<p>I take the car home. I get one last burst of energy for a telegram that I send to Herbie Allen Hirschfield. It says: BELIEVE YOU ARE BLOWING A BILLION. NO ONE KNOWS HOW HUGE CE3K IS.</p>
				<p>I get no response.</p>
				<p>Rona announces the following day that I am no longer the captain of the ship of <em>Close Encounters</em>. Since the picture is about to go to negative cutting, and therefore in the dock, there is no way to respond.</p>
				<p>Nobody but Frank Warner calls.</p>
				<p>Two days later, Grady calls. I think he is calling to comfort me, but it is a you-fucked-it-up call instead. Kendall says he’s been waiting a year to make that call... <em>and murdered on this spot...</em></p>
				<p>Randy Fields brings me a final proof of the ad. I cut all the exclamation points and excise the period after <em>WE ARE NOT ALONE.</em></p>
				<p>The answer print is run for me at Todd-AO. I sit alone in a darkened room, pad and pen with light in hand. “The experience” seems a tad leaden, cut between the beat. As it were. The effects stay on too long, congratulating themselves. I write heads and tails cuts furiously. When the lights come up, I sigh deeply and tear them up. Who cares...</p>
				<p><em>L’affaire</em> Begelman breaks... he’s in, he’s out. Columbia stock is suspended from trading for a day. How did Ariel know that? I weep for my picture. With me gone and him gone, and the power struggles and ego confrontations that will surely ensue, I know the release will be half-assed. I feel like four years of my life have slipped through the cracks. When his case comes up in Burbank, Judge Thomas J. Murphy presiding, he gets a five-thousand-dollar fine and community service... Less than me...</p>
				<p>I half sink into drugs. I show up for the screenings in New York and L.A. A press conference has been arranged after the one in New York. I have been placed half off to the side, between Alan Hyneck and Doug Trumbull, far away from Steven, which hurts me deeply. I am late and disgrace myself even further by slurring my words while answering a question. Not the best public speaking. (345ff.)</p>

				<p>Steven takes a tentative puff on my joint, coughs, and passes it back to me. We haven’t spoken in four years, but we have run into each other on the MGM lot, where he is directing <em>Poltergeist</em>. He is supposed to be producing it, but Tobe Hooper, the director, it is whispered, has lost his cookies and Steven has had to step in. I wonder if Steven has been the first to whisper the Hooper rumors. It would fit his m.o. We are acting as if nothing bad ever happened between us, and Steven has walked back to my set of offices with me, the ex-offices of Louis B. Mayer, which I have defiled with acres of chintz.</p>
				<p>Steven has asked for the joint, which surprises me, he is such a straightnik. Maybe it is his way of getting along with me on my terms. We hang out for a considerable period, and I am furious the entire time. I don’t indicate this externally at all, so I am working on a hell of a stomach ache. Thank God there is no Sara Lee anything around.</p>
				<p>“Yup, all hell is gonna break loose in this room,” Steven says. “We’re gonna rotate the whole room day after tomorrow...” Oh yeah, I got a better idea of something you should rotate. And where you should rotate it.</p>
				<p>“You love doing that sort of stuff,” I reply instead, thinking of Dreyfuss in the cab of the truck, Nick McLean, the camera operator, turning in a 360-degree circle right along with him so that all the papers and ashtray stuff appeared to be rising and floating, the result of the powerful beam emanating from the spaceship above and off-camera. They did it twice until Nick was hurled from the heavy straps that held him in.</p>
				<p>We’d only gotten two takes, but that was enough, and both guys were green at the gills, ready to puke their guts out, anyway. Steven, oblivious, wanted another take. Nick looked like he was ready to barf all over him, something he wanted to do anyway, just so he’d get the point. Nick had great respect for Steven on the one hand, but called him Speelnuts on the other. Steven intuitively backed down.</p>
				<p>“You should come by and see it...” he says now.</p>
				<p>“Yeah, sure,” I say, coughing violently on the pot and my lie. I will never be on another set with you again. And being on a set with you was probably the most fun I ever had. Which gives you an idea of how much fun I’ve had in my life. We have been talking about Michael and me breaking up and the effect it had on all our pals.</p>
				<p>“It was like Mommy and Daddy breaking up and we were all your children... it was scary,” he says.</p>
				<p>“Yeah, but we made all those calls... we told you we’d make the business part work... we <em>did</em> make the business part work...” So weird, split up and keep all those projects together. Hey, but not as weird as Harry Ufland or Bob Bookman splitting with their wives and subdividing their houses so the children wouldn’t freak out. But that was business, too.</p>
				<p>“Yeah, but it was like we had to choose...” Ah, Steven, do we really wanna pursue this? Nah... but I say:</p>
				<p>“That was in your head, not in ours...”[...]</p>
				<p>“How’s the baby?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“She’s great... she’s seven...”</p>
				<p>“God, time flies...” The last time he’d seen her was when she was a baby. “Got a picture?”</p>
				<p>“Sure,” I said, pleased, and looked deep into the recesses of my purse, fumbled through my wallet, extracted a two-year-old snap. “Here...” I held it out for him to see, but he was gone...</p>
				<p>The screening was very fancy-shmancy; the movie, too. The tragedies of the uptight midwestern goyim. When it was over, I leaned into Craig’s ear and said, “And they wouldn’t let me direct <span class="movietitle">Fear of Flying</span>...” and got a huge, rude laugh. I knew I did it because Redford had slighted me. Uh-oh, shades of the Old Julia, or anyway, the part of the Old Julia nobody seemed to like much...</p>

He angled the ramp higher and he drove too fast. Maybe it was because he knew that there was so much brass there that night. Stanley... Alan... Michael...</p>
				<p>Maybe he was just a young showoff.</p>
				<p>It took a long time to hear the word <em>action</em>, and then the moment with all five cameras rolling flew by. Just like that.</p>
				<p>But I could tell by the inactivity from Craig’s cop car that something was amiss. I was dressed in the mink, it was that cold. Me and my mink went skittling down the embankment to see what was wrong.</p>
				<p>It wasn’t clear immediately that his heel was crushed in forty places, because the paramedic and the other guys seemed more concerned with his head. They eased the helmet off and we were all relieved to see that there was no blood, but we could see from his eyes that he was hurt and that he was going into shock.</p>
				<p><em>Keep talking to him</em>, I remembered, from other accidents I had witnessed. I knelt over him and talked. He kept asking me if we got the shot, and if Steven was pleased.</p>
				<p>Michael came down off the hill and talked to him, and while he did, I ran back up to Steven. The paramedic ran off in the other direction to call for an ambulance.</p>
				<p>“I don’t wanna go down there,” Steven said, huddling close to Stanley and Alan.</p>
				<p>“Just for a second, just tell him what a great stunt it was, and that all five cameras got the shot...”</p>
				<p>I guess he decided he would look pussy in front of the big guys if he didn’t go, although they sure weren’t making any moves in that direction, because he eased down the slope and said a few kind words to Craig, who at that point was vaguing in and out of consciousness.</p>
				<p>I dismissed Steven and Michael and I kept talking. Craig looked shivery, so I flung my coat over him. I could tell the other stunt guys felt conflicted about the gesture.</p>
				<p>Well, it was a little Lady Bountiful, but it sure beat the rest of the Jews who were standing at the edge of the precipice looking, but not coming, down. Elders from an ancient tribe, looking down on some human sacrifice. A shot in a movie.</p>
				<p>Truth be told, I did retrieve the mink when the ambulance arrived a full hour later. At least in this current situation, St. Vincent’s was a stone’s throw from location, and the injured party is removed from the scene almost immediately.</p>
				<p>Kilik and Wechsler are hardly Jaffe and Hirschfield, but in my script they are stand-ins, and while we are all performing, I feel a feeling I get too often: I am being deserted and left alone.</p>
				<p>I call Bob Wallerstein first and Vestron second. Freeze frame: blood coming out of the guy’s eyes and I wonder if he is going to live.</p>
				<p>How do I feel about that? Bad. Inconvenienced. Jesus. The soul of the picture maker.</p>
				<p>Which is to say... No soul.</p>
				<p>Yeah, Steven had been there for sure, I bet.</p>
				<p>And Landis. That little megalomaniacal prick. I had been coming off a plane from Hawaii and he was shooting that dog, <span class="movietitle">Into the Night</span>, with Jeff Goldblum. He stopped the whole production in the middle of a shot to say hello. <em>Little prick.</em></p>
				<p>Too bad. He hadn’t started out that way. Like Simpson, he had started out a movie lover and a movie believer, if somewhat neuropsychotic. Michael and I met him when he first came to L.A., with Donald Sutherland committed to <span class="movietitle">An American Werewolf in London</span>, and some prints of his first movie, <span class="movietitle">Schlock</span>, under his arm.</p>
				<p>He had an articulate enthusiasm about him that made him childlike enough to seem like a prodigy. Michael and I were so impressed that when Steven was on the brink of hiring Tracey Keenan Wynn (at Guy’s urging) for the fifth rewrite of <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, Michael schlepped Landis up for a weekend to meet him.</p>
				<p>Steven hated him, although Michael and I always wondered if he felt threatened, Landis being so child-prodigy and all, Steven pretty much feeling he had the corner on that arena. There’s always someone younger than you.</p>
				<p>Landis didn’t get the gig, but hung around Martha’s Vineyard for the summer and made serious bread as an extra in <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>. They got to be big pals long after I had departed the scene. (478)</p>

				<p>But what was the function of this obscure corporate entity?</p>
				<p>According to Ed Morey, the Warner Brothers VP assigned to the project, Twilight Zone Productions had its own payroll system, independent of Warner Brothers, named “DISC Management Systems, Inc.” (Grand jury)</p>
				<p>The Production Coordinator (Schuman) testified that: “George Folsey instructed Disc Management to issue a check for petty cash” (Grand jury).</p>
				<p>Not much is known about Disc Management Systems, Inc. Its name (as far as this author knows) appears in the credits of only a single released feature film—Amblin’s <span class="movietitle">Arachnophobia</span> (1990)—and had its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hwxt6ZWJieIjgLf3ZgLI058FhCF601k6/view?usp=share_link">corporate address at the fringe of the Warner Brothers lot</a> (3601 W.

				<p>The corporate address of DISC Management is significant because the cheque instrumental in the hiring of the children came from Twilight Zone Productions, Inc. on a Warner Bros cheque. Landis’s offices at the time were on the Universal lot.</p>

				<a id="section-11"></a><h3>#11. The stumble</h3>

				<p>During the final shot, Morrow is captured on film stumbling to his knees, just seconds before the helicopter hits the ground. Had he been standing, it’s possible that he could have run for cover.</p>
				<p>When Landis took the stand in February 1987 as the first witness for the defense, he spent several days telling his side of the story, from how he got his start in the industry, all the way up to the accident. It was at this point that Landis testified that Morrow’s stumble had in fact been staged, improvised by the two of them about 20 minutes prior to the fatal shot, during the 2:00am technical rehearsal.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>It was planned that Vic should stumble... I think you are having a problem with the fact that what makes this so especially terrible, which is that they are acting, that Vic is acting, and it looks  horrendous. Because it's supposed to look horrendous. And the tragedy makes it that much harder to watch. (qtd. In LaBrecque, 233)</p>
				</div>

				<p>On one hand, the claim that the stumble had been planned helped substantiate the general claim that the 2:20 shot had been adequately rehearsed. On the other, it only seemed to raise more questions.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA (D’Agostino):</span> How did you rehearse it then if they [Morrow or his stand-in, Robert Liddle] weren’t carrying the children?”</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> I don’t know how — That is such an odd question. What do you mean? Could you explain?”</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Mr. Landis, isn’t it true, sir, that you have seen the film and you saw how horrendous, in fact, it did look to have Vic Morrow struggling in the water? And that he did almost, in fact, drop Renee? And that you manufactured this story about how it was all planned for Vic to stumble, because of how terrible it did look on the film? Isn’t that true, sir?”</p>
					<p>JL: No, it is not true.” (qtd. in LaBrecque, 233)</p>
				</div>

				<p>(Cont’d—Courtroom transcripts:)</p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> And this is the point in time in which you supposedly told Vic Morrow — or you discussed him falling down, right, or tripping, or stumbling?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Soon after that, yes.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Well did you ever tell the grand jury that it was planned for Vic Morrow to stumble or to fall?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> No.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Did you tell the NTSB that it was planned for Morrow to stumble or to fall?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> I didn’t... I don’t think so.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Did you tell the Camera Operators to be sure and watch for that, because that was going to occur?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Yes. I wouldn’t know which camera now. As we saw the footage, he was in a specific spot that we had discussed for that camera, and I am sorry, I don’t...—</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> The master camera, Mr. Lydecker?</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> No, certainly not the master. Whichever one would have been tightest on Vic and the Children.</p>
				</div>

<p> (Camera A, Rich Benda, told the NTSB otherwise: Quote) </p>

				<p>The DA continued to drive at the question of whether Landis had done any rehearsal or preparation for a stumble with regards to the actual children being used. Landis recalled the 9:30 shot.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">JL:</span> Yes, I asked if the children if they could swim. One could and one could not.</p>
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA:</span> Why did you need to know at 9:30 if the children could swim?</p>
				</div>

				<p>Was it possible that the two dropped children witnessed by House and Morrow’s Stand-in (Robert Liddle) just before and during the 9:30 shot were rehearsals for a stumble that had been planned further in advance than Landis admitted?</p>

				<a id="section-12"></a><h3>#11. Beer and liquor runs for the SFX team</h3>

				<p>The NTSB had found two beer cans in the cabin of the helicopter.</p>
				<p>Carl Pittman, one of the special effects drivers:</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Mr. Pittman stated that during the afternoon prior to the fatal crash, he had personally consumed a couple of beers that he had purchased and had personally seen Paul Stewart, head of special effects, consume at least one beer. He also observed Paul Stewart’s assistant, named Jerry, drink one beer. He stated that to his recollection, it was approximately 1600 hours on July 22, 1982.</p>
					<p>Mr. Pittman stated that although some of these special effects people did consume beer, it was a rule of Paul Stewart’s that when they started handling explosives there would be no consumption of alcohol.</p>
					<p>He stated that the 10-ton powder truck was positioned in the area of the Chapman crane and for most of the evening, this is where he spent his time.</p>
					<p>He stated that at approximately 2330 hours, he went over to where the special effects pickup truck was parked on a ridge between the village and the dam, to relieve the other driver, named Ted, for lunch. He stated that when he went over to this location, he brought with him a vinyl bucket which contained soda pop and water. He stated that he saw no alcoholic beverages, including beer, consumed by anyone in the village area during this period of time.</p>
					<p>He stated that one of the functions that he fulfilled, in addition to being driver, was to make runs to the store for Paul Stewart and his crew. During these runs he would occasionally purchase beer, sodas, tools, and other equipment, as requested by Paul Stewart or members of his crew.</p>
					<p>He stated that when he observed Paul Stewart and "Jerry" drinking a beer, they were in the area of the 10-ton truck near the Chapman crane.</p>
					<p>Mr. Pittman continued that after he would make purchases, he would give the receipts to Paul Stewart, at which time he would be reimbursed. Mr. Pittman stated that it was not uncommon for people to be drinking beer on the set, that the prop truck had its own cooler which contained sodas and beer. He stated that he saw no bottles of whiskey or vodka; however, these types of alcoholic beverages were usually locked in a cabinet. Mr. Pittman was not specific as to whether there was a cabinet of liquor on this particular set.</p>
					<p>He stated that it was the following day when he and members of the special effects crew met at the Burbank Studios and off-loaded material.</p>
					<p>Mr. Pittman stated that around the time of the 2330 hour filming, while in the area of the 10-ton powder truck, he smelled the odor of marijuana and stated that although this is not common on most sets, that it is around.</p>
					<p>He stated that he had overheard comments that the “powers to be were flying high,” referring to drug usage, but Mr. Pittman was unable to be specific as to who was relating this rumor and to whom they were referring. He stated that in his opinion, he did not believe that anyone that he observed was either drunk or under the influence of drugs.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Theldyanamos Triantafellow, the other special effects driver:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>He was about to drive across the river, enroute to the area of the 10-ton truck, when he was stopped by the helicopter pilot. He said the pilot wanted a ride across the river to “pick up something”. He stated the pilot was holding a can of something in his hand. He stated he refused to give the pilot a ride because there were explosives on the vehicle which he was driving.</p>
					<p>Mr. Triantafellow asked investigators to turn off the tape recorder, with which we complied. At this time he stated that the pilot was holding a red and white can of “Budweiser” beer, and that this was just prior to the crash flight. He stated that Carl was purchasing whiskey, vodka, and beer for the special effects men and was being reimbursed by them. He said that that evening Carl showed him receipts for purchases totalling $150.00, which Carl indicated was for beverage purchases.</p>
					<p>He said that after the crash, he left the location, driving the pickup truck, following Carl, who was driving the 10-ton powder truck. He said that Carl was weaving badly all the way back to the Burbank Studios. He said he was alone in the pickup truck and that Carl was alone in the 10-ton truck.</p>
					<p>He concluded that, while on the set, he recalled asking ANDY HOUSE what kids were doing on the night set. He said Mr. House told him to mind his own business. (Police report)</p>
				</div>

				<p>The matter was especially hard to sort out because the last day of the production was traditionally designated its “wrap party.” In the case of July 21st, 1982, it was also designated the production’s “family day.” On both the nights of July 21st, and July 22nd/23rd, the canteen near to the set was stocked with alcohol.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Concerning alcohol on the set, he stated there was "booze" all over; the company furnishes beer for the employees after the wrap-up. He stated he could not remember if anyone was drinking beer on the set that night. He concluded that he has seen empty beer cans in the huts that made up the Vietnamese village. (Ishmael Ruiz, Lighting Technician, Police report)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Budds’ initial investigation:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>In the area where these body parts were lying, investigators observed several Budweiser beer cans which were still cold to the touch. These cans were open and several still contained a gold foamy-type liquid resembling and smelling like beer. This area was determined to be a "gallery" area for onlookers observing the filming. There were also several empty vodka bottles. (Police report)</p>

				<a id="section-13"></a><h3>#13. No longer eligible for prosecution</h3>

				<p>In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Marshall is reported by Chain to have emerged from his point of cover beneath a nearby truck, and joined the many dazed crew members wading towards the wreck looking for survivors. Chain also reports that Marshall was the one to retrieve the body of Renee Chen and bring it to shore, and that he told the 2nd AD to clear the set and to make sure the film was on the truck. Folsey and Marshall lead a wailing Mrs. Chen, and a startled shell-shocked Dr. Le to separate production vehicles headed for the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia.</p>
				<p>There was a medic on-set, but no police. The nearest telephone was in a booth at the entrance of the park. (Two crew members said they would have called the labor board, but there was no phone access nearby.) Deputies Sinclair and Straight, from the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station had received a call at 2:45am and arrived shortly after. Budds was dispatched at 4:15am and arrived at 6:10am.</p>
				<p>That morning, Landis’s studio-assigned typist (Alpha Campbell) documented that at 10:15am Marshall called and “needs a lot of things,” and showed up to the office 15 minutes later and took—at least—several rolls of film.</p>
				<p>Chain reports that within days of the accident Marshall gave his account of events to Warner Bros’s attorneys, as documented in a series of interoffice memos (Chain Ch. 25; Ch. 27, etc.) possibly shared as a matter of discovery with defendants or suspects who participated in these unofficial depositions (e.g. Elie Cohn) and then circulated among the defendants’ massive legal network.</p>
				<p>Farber & Green report that, “Right after the accident, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy left town to spend two weeks at Marshall’s retreat in Idaho. When they returned, Marshall stayed only a short time in Los Angeles; then left the country with Spielberg to scout locations for <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom”</span> (158).</p>
				<p>By August 2nd, the Chen family had filed their lawsuit, in which both Spielberg and Marshall were named.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d019.jpg">
					<figcaption>In October, Marshall filmed a cameo as one of four airplane ground crew (wearing a yellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_\(mythology\">Mercury</a> wings hat) for George Miller’s segment Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, shot in October 1982.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d020.png">
					<figcaption><span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: the Movie</span> was actually Marshall’s second cameo in a Spielberg movie. The first was as “the pilot” in <span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>’s famous tarmac fistfight.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>By October, according to Chain, Marshall had already been informed by CAL/Osha that his name was not being passed to the D.A. for indictment. In the initial confusion after the accident, with the jurisdictional considerations splitting the investigation into three factions, the NTSB interviewed some 31 witnesses to the accident, but Marshall was not among them. According to Chain, earlier, Marshall’s attorneys had petitioned the CAL/Osha investigator, Marilyn Levine, to exclude Marshall from her investigation, emphasizing the distance between Marshall (who operated on the Warner Bros lot), and Landis’s people (who operated on the Universal Studios lot). Allegedly, when Marshall’s counsel misrepresented the number of days their client appeared on set, from at least 8 of 12 days, to only on the set three or four times total (Chain Ch. 39).</p>
				<p>And then in late November/December, Spielberg and Kennedy at least were in town: finishing Spielberg’s Twilight Zone segment; hosting a Japanese television crew making a documentary; and having an early-December story bootcamp with Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck that established the plot for what became <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</span></p>
				<p>Oddly enough, Alpha Campbell also noted that On January 12, 1983, Frank Marshall returned to John Landis’s office to pick up a few more items.</p>
			
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>1:40 PM — Phone Call:<br>Michael Topher, Spielberg’s producer, called last night. He asked for the call sheet. I told him no one was here. He said he’d come look for it. I told him absolutely not — I shouldn’t let anyone into the office.</p>

				</div>

				<p>By this time, Budds had been trying to circle back to Marshall for a while, with Marshall’s attorney assuring him Marshall was out of town and unavailable but would cooperate at his earliest possibility. Then Budds heard Marshall was back in town. But Marshall was never at his legal residence. And whenever Budds stopped by Universal Studios and the booth operator called ahead to the Amblin bungalow, Budds was always informed by Bonne or Mary Radford that Marshall was not on the lot at the moment.</p>
				<p>By February 1983, Marshall’s attorney informed Sgt. Budds that his client had decided not to cooperate with investigators willingly. A domestic subpoena was issued for his testimony, but Marshall couldn’t be located at his home or work despite repeated visits by Sgt. Budds, and the case’s lone investigator had bigger fish to fry (LaBrecque 95). In the years to come the DA successfully navigated a Grand Jury hearing (June 1983), Preliminary Hearing (Feb 1984), and Appeal (June 1984).</p>
				<p>Spielberg and Kennedy at least were in L.A. for a disappointing 1983 Oscars, when Spielberg <em>E.T.</em> failed to win the big award—the movie’s aura tainted, to whatever degree, by its association with the tragedy.</p>
				<p>The filming for <span class="movietitle">Temple of Doom</span> took place between April 18th, 1983 in Sri Lanka and continuing through September 8th, 1983, at Elstree Studios in London.</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>George Folsey, Jr., told me [LaBrecque] that the defendants, too, wanted Marshall to testify, to corroborate Landis's statements about the decision to hire the children illegally. He said that Landis talked to Spielberg after the preliminary hearing and asked him to intercede with Marshall. "Whether [Spielberg] attempted it, I don't know. Obviously, Frank went out of the country and avoided the subpoenas," Folsey said.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Cal/OSHA had decided back in the fall of 1982 that legally speaking Marshall wasn’t culpable for the hiring. But they were mistaken, as discovered by Allingham’s attorney Leonard Levine in 1985, when posing as a film producer and asking DLSE (Department of Labor Standards Enforcement) Chief of the Entertainment Work Permit Unit, Howard Bacon, whether in the case of an accident on-set the crew would be responsible, or the corporation and upper-level management, receiving an unequivocal answer that: </p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>...it was the production company which is deemed the sole employer of the minors, as well as of all other members of the cast, crew, and supporting personnel. If there is more than one production company or executive producer they are each jointly and severally liable as employers of the minors et al. If the production compani(ies) is incorporated its corporate officers are responsible under the Labor Code and the COMM’N’s regulations and guidelines as the employers of the minors.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Marshall was almost certainly a corporate officer at both Twilight Zone Productions, Inc. and <a href="#section-10">DISC Management Systems, Inc.</span> (the payroll company contracted to oversee the production’s spending).</p>
				<p>This, along with Braun’s two letters to the DA in November 1985, alleging that knowledge of the hiring was widespread, led to increased interest in Marshall’s testimony. With the statute of limitations expired, Marshall was no longer eligible for prosecution.</p>

				Braun later told Farber & Green:
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Obviously, regardless of what the DA had done, I could have laid a subpoena on Frank Marshall at any time over a three-year period. But Behr [Landis’s personal lawyer] told me, ‘No, we’re not going to do that. It’s too dangerous to the clients’ careers.’ If Spielberg got mad at Landis, Landis could not get a job in this city. (234)</p>
				</div>

				<p>In June 1986, the DA and the Sheriff’s Department tracked Marshall to London, England, where he was staying at St. James’s Hotel and Club, a luxury boutique hotel, working on Amblin’s <span class="movietitle">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</span>? at the famous Elstree Studios. Sgt. Budds was sent overseas to personally serve Marshall a new subpoena, but because of his lack of jurisdiction, Budds had to enlist a young legal attaché from the American Embassy to serve the legal document.</p>
				<p>Sgt. Budds listened as she called Marshall from the front desk. Marshall assured her he would be right down. They waited for him for half an hour but he never showed up. A report from Scotland Yard said that Marshall was in Paris, where Spielberg also was at the time, promoting Amblin’s <span class="movietitle">The Money Pit</span>. The report speculated—based on the absence of Marshall’s names from any public flight records—that he had taken a private jet operated by Amblin Entertainment (cf. LaBrecque 128, F&G 241-243, McBride 348, Chain Ch. 42).</p>
				<p>Given the seriousness of the multiple-homicide trial at issue, Interpol became involved, and Marshall’s name was added to an international “stop and hold” list, along with his longtime girlfriend, Kathleen Kennedy. In fact, Kennedy was intercepted after landing in Barcelona in February 1987, and Marshall on April 7th, 1987, in Madrid (LaBrecque) for pre-production on <span class="movietitle">Empire of the Sun</span>.</p>
				<p>But by this time the prosecution had rested their case and Marshall’s testimony was no longer of any help.</p>
				<p>Even if the memo were spurious, it at least provides a plausible alternative to Landis et al’s narrative, rather than Marshall in particular (and the filmmakers more generally), who have successfully pursued a strategy of avoidance.</p>
				<p>As well, Marshall implied the use of the children in the final shot, but not the 9:30pm shot, was the possible result of <a href="#section-04n">a semantic misunderstanding</a> between him and Allingham during their second meeting in early July. Could it explain the whole tragedy?</p>

						<p>32 ASIAN RIVER - NIGHT</p>
						<p>The helicopter spots them and guns blazing, heads toward the river. As Bill carrying the kids desperately makes his way through the water, the helicopter makes several passes strafing the area. Bill makes it to shore and sees a wooden shed. Making a super-human attempt he manages to get all three of them inside. He stacks the wood inside against the door, then huddles with the kids in the corner.</p>

						<p>33 EXT. SHED - THE WOODS - NIGHT</p>
						<p>The shed is now in the pine woods. Dogs barking, torches burning. [...]</p>
				</div></div>

				<p>The shed scenes are significant for providing plausible deniability to the Locations Manager (Richard Vane) who was the highest ranking member of the production to admit to participating in a conspiracy to conceal the children from a Fire Safety Officer known to work also as an On-Set Teacher and Child Welfare Worker.</p>
				<p>Vane was able at the Grand Jury hearing to both (1) admit he was actively participating in the conspiracy at the time of the accident (2:20am); and (2) claim that he, and Frank Marshall—standing beside him—didn’t believe the children were going to be used in the shot. Vane was able to say that he believed the concealment plan was ongoing for the sake of the last scene.</p>

				<div class="transcript">
					<p><span class="transcript-name">DA (Kesselman):</span> Did you know they would be there in violation of the law?
					<p><span class="transcript-name">RV:</span> Yes, I knew that they were going to be there. I did not think that they would be in the explosion scene. There was a scene that was going to follow that in which the kids were in a shelter. (Grand jury)</p>
				</div>

				<p>But was it true?</p>
				<p>Tice told the Grand Jury that Vane checked on his whereabouts three times in the lead-up to the 2:20am shot specifically.</p>
				
				<div class="transcript">
					<p>Did someone have conversations with you on Thursday that in retrospect you now think were somewhat out of the ordinary or order?</p>
					<p>“Yes, Richard Vane wanted to know where I was going to be during the filming of the 2:30 scene... he asked me that on three occasions. I think it was unusual. I did not think much of it at the time, but afterwards I thought it was quite unusual. And the reason for it is because the fire deputy had— we had six firemen there, and we were coordinating the fire efforts, representing the county fire department. And it was quite unusual for him to insist on knowing where I was going to be.”</p>

				<a id="section-15"></a><h3>#15. Chain claims</h3>

				<p>Journalist Steve Chain claims access to several inter-departmental Warner Brothers memos documenting interviews conducted by their legal team with various Warner Brothers employees, including Marshall, Fisher, Vane, Radford, Henderling, Morey, and Cohn.</p>
				<p>Although this is an audacious claim, and Chain’s book has no notes, references, or sources, there are several reasons to find it plausible. (1) Chain attended the trial at the time and is recommended by other reporters that covered the trial; (2) the book is endorsed by Harland Braun, Landis’ pre-trial lawyer; (3) If Cohn was questioned by Warner Bros.' legal counsel in a non-privileged context and without independent representation, and records of that questioning existed, it is plausible that his later counsel—or other defense attorneys—could have obtained access to those records through discovery, making it possible that Chain, through defense cooperation, encountered them; (4) all findings in the book are consistent with established evidence.</p>

				<a id="section-16"></a><h3>#16. Alternate versions</h3>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p><span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span> has always meant, more than anything else, those little musical notes that you hear from the other room—like a bugle call that draws you to the television set and grips you for half an hour. (Spielberg, qtd. in F&G 63)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Co-Producer Steven Spielberg—along with Executive Producer Frank Marshall, Warner Brothers President of Creative, Lucy Fisher, and Warner Brothers President of Production, Terry Semel—was sent Landis’ initial draft and each of its three revisions (James Neal, opening statements). Spielberg’s input would have been highly valued. As of June 11th, 1982, <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>, <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> had all been released within the previous calendar year. Owing to his success with these films, Warner Brothers had a fiduciary obligation to solicit Spielberg’s professional opinion. As well, not only Warner Brothers, but Amblin, and Spielberg and Marshall specifically, were literally invested in <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>’s box office success. In a more practical sense, Spielberg, as co-producer, would need to know what was going on in the other segments. This would enable him to manage overall themes and plan the sequence of the segments, including transitions between them. Joe Dante, the director of the third segment, “It’s a Good Life,” said that originally the concept was that “all the stories were going to connect.”</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Originally the concept was that characters from one episode would appear in another, so that it wasn't just a series of  free-standing stories. It was all linked together. So it seemed like it was a long piece. (Dante)</p>
				</div>

				<p>In fact, the first revision of Landis’ script (May 24th) ends with the lines:</p>

	      <div class="scriptexcerpt">
    	    <div class="scriptexcerpt-left">
						<p>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
						<p>Ray smiles, and he and Larry help Bill walk to his car as the CAMERA pans up to see a 747 roar across the sky.</p>
						<p>CUT TO:</p>
						<p>INT. 747 - DAY</p>
						<p>TO BE CONTINUED BY MR. MATHESON</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>“Matheson” is Richard Matheson, the writer of the other three segments. This version punctuates the transition to another segment, “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” which takes place on a 747. This indicates that Landis’ revisions were at least inclusive of broader production conversations concerning the movie as a whole, which would have necessarily involved Spielberg.</p>
				<p>According to George Miller’s account of being added to the movie in late May ‘82, the movie was a going concern for Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy. "They were having a meeting to discuss The Twilight Zone. I remember Steven was there, Kathy Kennedy, and a few others, and they invited me to sit down. Up to that time, it had been planned to do three stories [not including the prologue], and now they'd decided to do a fourth. 'Why don't you do one?' someone said. I wasn't sure they weren't having me on at the time." </p>
				<p>According to Joe Dante, prior to the accident the movie was conceived as a mixture of old and new stories. </p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>There was a lot of talk about [remaking] old episodes,” Dante recently recalled. “I didn't really want to do an old episode—I thought there [were] so many great stories that hadn't been done on the <em>Twilight Zone</em> that you could do four new stories. But I think that for whatever reason the studio insisted on doing remakes. [...] Steven's first thought was to remake “It's a Good Life,” about the little kid with truly awful powers[...] That's the segment I ultimately inherited. (Cinefex #14)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Dante explained further how the conceit of the movie would work: </p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>When Steve was still planning to do his Halloween story, there was a big chase at the end, which would have linked up to mine when the camera suddenly pulled back and you saw that the chase was actually part of a video game being played by the kid at the beginning of my story. I think the Kathleen Quinlan character in my episode lost something when it was decided to put George’s episode after mine. Originally, the ambulance taking John Lithgow away from the plane goes past the hospital, just as Kathleen is leaving with a friend. Her mother has just died, and she is giving up teaching. All she wants to do is go out in the world and learn things.</p>
				</div>

				<p>George Miller, the fourth director to be added, would remake the classic '60s episode Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, another segment which Spielberg wanted to see in the movie. Spielberg and Landis were going to direct the originals.</p>
				<p>Besides the prologue and Landis’ segment, all three were going to be written by Richard Matheson, a prolific original Twilight Zone screenwriter, who also wrote Spielberg’s hit TV movie <span class="movietitle">Duel</span> (1971) about a giant semi-truck that terrorizes an anxious, deferential man. Spielberg was working closely with him on an original segment about a neighborhood bully who on Halloween becomes prey to supernatural forces.</p>
				<p>Spielberg described it as follows: </p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Basically, this is a neighborhood bully, whose costume happens to be the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Trick or treat isn’t enough for him – he runs amok across the streets on Halloween, egging houses, leaving burning bags of dog manure on the front porch; stealing bags from other kids; and single-handedly ruining the holiday for everyone he can – enjoying every minute of his mischief. That is, until... a few strange things commence to happen. It’s been years since I read the script, but I remember a postbox lurching at him; I remember a little girl in a witch’s costume suddenly growing into an ugly, full-sized witch lurching out to seize him. I remember the streets full of ‘REAL’ werewolves and patched-together Frankenstein Monsters and vampires, all stalking him in earnest. I remember a doorknob attempting to BITE his hand when he tries to take refuge in his own house. And ultimately, I remember that when he thinks he is safe in his own home, safe at last from the unexpected horrors which have transformed his neighborhood into a living hell, he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the hall mirror, and he sees Quasimodo – the real thing. His simple makeup and costume are gone. He IS Quasimodo! Horrified, he runs out of the house in total disorientation, and the monsters catch sight of him, and we last see them in close pursuit as he stumbles on his twisted legs across a large vacant lot with the huge October moon in the sky beyond. (Twilight Zone Magazine 1983)</p>
				</div>

				<p>Matheson summarized it as "a bully who's mistreating all these young trick-or-treating kids, and the supernatural world gets him for it. Creatures—real live monsters—start chasing him around." And then the mask becomes fused to his face. According to McBride, it was based on a feature Spielberg had been developing for MGM (343).</p>

				<p>Work on the Spielberg-Matheson project proceeded well into the summer of 1982. During an interview for Starlog magazine, which focused on the by-then phenomenal success of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, Spielberg said of his <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> segment, “[W]e have all these monsters we have to build” (Starlog #62, cf. McBride 342). The creature effects were going to be done by Craig Reardon, who did the effects for Landis’ prologue, ‘Real Scary’, as well as ‘It’s A Good Life’, and ‘Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.’</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In order, then, it was going to go ‘Bigot’; ‘Hunchback’; ‘Nightmare’; ‘It’s a Good Life.’ And then at some point before the accident, according to McBride, Spielberg decided he would remake ‘The Monsters are Due on Maple Street.’ After the accident, he changed his sequence again, to another classic episode, ‘Kick the Can.’ All four of the segments in the finished movie include the loose unifyer of being about characters caught in schizoid states.</p>

				</figure>

				<a id="section-16b"></a><p>Landis had intended a powerful message: “In ‘Time Out’ I wanted to be true to the spirit of the old TZ show and to inject a lot of Serling's own politics and morality into that episode... It's the only political or moral episode in the film, actually (Twilight Zone Magazine Oct. 1983).”</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d026.png">
					<figcaption>Bill’s companions in the car. The version of the movie released in theaters reverted back to the original draft, in which Bill sees his friends exit the bar, before the freight car he’s been thrown into pulls away for the death camps.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Bill’s dialogue in the bar scene is more significant than it seems. We learn that he has been working at his job for 17 years (since 1966 or 1967); that the promotion he lost is going to cost him $6,000/year, and that he was “counting on it”; that his house is owned by a Japanese bank; that he was “in the war” and “paid to kill [Asians]”; and that he has to go home early to meet his in-laws. We have the sketch of a man using racism as a way of blaming everyone else for his misfortunes, culminating, it seems, in the imminent threat of losing his house to a bank owned by the same “Asians” (in Bill’s calculation) that America, back in “the war,” neglected to exterminate completely. He faults the Jews—clever and greedy—for his career setbacks, and resents being thought of as belonging to the same social basement as blacks—i.e., the lowly working class. Over the course of his journey, Morrow experiences what it really means to be victimized by a powerful other, showing his complaints to be a screen for continued aggression. However, by the end of the story, once it reaches its ‘root’ in his Vietnam reversal, we sense that Bill’s racism and the personal failures it masks are a coping mechanism for guilt he feels over what he did in the war and what it implies about him as a person and the state that paid him. But what exactly Bill did is ambiguous. Did he fail to save two children, out of cowardice? Was he part of the 1st Cavalry Division, associated with the firebombing villages and shooting at villagers indiscriminately? Or is the transmission intentionally general? Was it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ia_Drang">Battle of Ia Drang</a> (1965)?</p>
				<p>The 3rd draft, which introduces the village segment and the two children, brings Landis’ episode into line with the rest of the segments. Spielberg, famously, of course, often incorporates children into his work.</p>
				<p>But a change in the 4th draft (6/26/82), the two-line addition of a “MacGuffin” (in storytelling terms, an emotionally-charged object of desire) is even more peculiar.</p>

				      <div class="scriptexcerpt">
    	    <div class="scriptexcerpt-left">
    	    	<p>The little Girl hands Bill a broken and naked Barbie Doll. </p>
						<p>Bill (genuinely touched), responds, “Thank you honey. Thank you very much.”</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>This simple prop substantiates the emotional reversal established in the previous revision, giving the audience a clearer point of focus for the projection of their own petty grievances and allowing them to participate in Bill’s spiritual purification.</p>
				<p>The 3rd and 4th drafts both also successively tweak the ending. In the 3rd, he’s hit by a truck offscreen, just in time for his friends to see, and “pinned under the rear tire of a truck.” In the 4th revision, his friends call out to him but it’s too late, and he’s “clipped by a car in the street in front of the bar” and “thrown violently to the curb.”</p>

	      <div class="scriptexcerpt">

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>The MacGuffin takes on a second significance, providing the evidence of a final twist—maybe it wasn’t an isolated psychotic break after all.</p>
				<p>Interestingly, the 4th draft seems to have never been turned over to investigators. The only copy of the script they were given was the 3rd draft (June 13th, 1982—without the doll and other subtle amendments) (Chain 187; Budds’ 1982 supplementary report only cites the 3rd draft (dated), not the fourth.).</p>
				<p>Each of the three historical narratives follows Morrow as he flees the dominant social group in a life-threatening manhunt, until he’s finally seized by the police in the Nazi timeline. According to Allingham, the narrative function of the spotlight was to induce a fear of the “police state” in the film.</p>
				
					<p>1941 timeline: “The beam falls on him, pinning him in its harsh spot-light.” (all versions.) </p>
					<p>1954/196? timeline transition: “A BLINDING LIGHT comes from the sky accompanied by tremendous winds and a deafening roar. Bill looks up in terror as a HUEY HELICOPTER descends on him.” (2nd Draft)</p>
					<p>196? timeline: “The helicopter turns on a powerful spotlight and hovers over the village sweeping it with its beam.” (3rd and 4th draft)</p>

				<p>Is the implication that Bill’s journey was a near-death hallucination after stepping into harm’s way, in the moment before his friends got outside? In this vision, he is instantly cured. His delusions are countered by the reversal, and he is confronted by the emotional denial that is the source of his cycling depression and hyper-reactivity.</p>
				<p>There’s also another, hypothetical, ending, which Mrs. Le reported hearing from Folsey or Landis on July 16th during their children’s auditions, in which Vic is crossing from a Vietnamese camp to an American camp.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>George Folsey Jr. told Mr. & Mrs. Le that they needed Vietnamese children for the movie; that the two children would be the last two (2) survivors left alone with actor Vic Morrow. Morrow was to pick up the two (2) children, and run across a stream or river to a shed for safety. A helicopter was to pick them up. (DLSE summary of August 2nd interview with Le family)</p>
				</div>

				<p>But it’s even unclear exactly <em>which version Landis was making</em>, or whether he was revising it as he went. In the movie, for instance, there is no spotlight used in the Nazi-era ledge scene. In the fatal 2:20am footage on July 23rd, the Barbie doll can be identified in Renee’s hands in the final shot. Because of the accident, Landis and Warner Brothers decided not to include the added segment with the children; this effectively reverted Landis’ segment back to its pre-June 13th state.</p>

				<p>"It was a very emotional time for Steven," Dante recalls. "Steven was very affected by the accident. Then he felt somewhat betrayed by it. He felt he couldn't understand what happened, and he suddenly became the brunt [of bad publicity]. I think he deeply resented it."</p>
				<p>According to Farber and Green, “the director did not even attend the pre-production meeting on the segment. “His heart just wasn’t in it anymore,” says Patrick Kehoe, the first AD” (174).</p>
				<p>“It probably is accurate to say that Mr. Spielberg's heart wasn't in the movie after the accident,”stated Spielberg's then-secretary Kathy Switzer. “[A]t the time, I didn't know Mr. Spielberg well enough to make a judgment about how he felt emotionally. I do know it was a very sad time.”</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Spielberg was so busy preparing detailed sketches for <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>... that he delegated some of his usual directing duties on <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>. ...he asked the script supervisor, Kathryn Wooten, and his friend Melissa Mathison (the screenwriter of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> and the wife of Harrison Ford), who had written the final draft of ‘Kick the Can’ under a pseudonym, to block out the action with the performers and work with them on their line readings.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Like the Landis episode, however, ‘Kick the Can’ went through several revisions. After the accident prompted Spielberg to switch his Halloween segment to a remake of a particularly Frank Capra-esque episode from Season 3 of the original series ‘Kick the Can’ (1962).</p>
				<p>But first, in light of the accident, before agreeing to license his teleplay, the <a href="http://twilightzonevortex.blogspot.com/2017/02/kick-can.html">original writer</a> insisted on meeting with Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, “and gave them a short, three page outline which contained a new ending to his story. In light of the accident, Johnson felt that his original teleplay was “a bit irresponsible in that it failed to portray the reality of the situation. These kids were now on their own with no one to take care of them. The outline featured an additional sequence which began where the original story ended, with the kids running off into the woods. It follows the kids on their adventure through the woods, laughing and playing, lost in the exhilaration of youth. As the excitement fades they grow tired and hungry and scared. The consequences of their actions become a reality. They stumble upon the rest home, unfamiliar to them now, and climb into the warm beds where they are transformed back into their older selves.”</p>
				<p>It was adapted by Matheson, who removed the scenes in the woods. Then, Spielberg had it reworked by Melissa Mathison (working under the pseudonym Josh Rogan), who gave it a whimsical Midsummer Night’s Dream gloss.</p>

				<p>Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler are archaeologists on a dig, used to brushing fossils by hand. They’re introduced to a seismic camera that takes a ‘shot’ into the dirt, and then they crowd around a set of monitors to watch a computer render an image. The technician tells us that within a few years it’ll make digging unnecessary, to Grant’s dismay.</p>
				<p>But he only realizes how radically the world is changing when Hammond arrives, who flies them off to his kitschy jungle resort on Isla Nublar (“Cloud Island”). Once there, Hammond displays his miraculous creative technology before taking them to a movie theater to show them how it’s done. The movie theater is also a theme-park ride that turns to reveal it’s adjacent to a genetics lab and a computerized control room.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d033.png">
				</figure>

				<p>And all of this reimagines the way the real life filmmakers encountered seamless CGI. One of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s defining quirks is the way it mythologizes its own unprecedented technological powers. We will see that this repetitive meta-reference functions as a new kind of surface distraction, obscuring deeper dynamics.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d034.png">
				</figure>

				<p><span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s dinosaurs were originally going to be achieved using a combination of animatronics, puppeteering, and stop-motion animated models, with CGI only to be used for subtle background work. <p>

<figure>
					<img src="../full/gifs/d16.gif">
				</figure>

			<p>	The form of stop-motion they were using was called Go-Motion. Tippett had developed it at George Lucas’ special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, before starting his own company, Tippet Studio. Go-Motion worked by using a computer to synchronize a camera with motorized puppets, allowing for a motion blur effect that improved realism compared to traditional stop motion. ILM was going to help implement it. </p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/gifs/d17.gif">
				</figure>

				<p>But when ILM received the commission in June ‘91 a few of their engineers thought they should be in charge, most notably Steve Williams and Mark A.Z. Dippé, who had been directly responsible for the astonishing but conspicuous CGI work on <span class="movietitle">The Abyss</span>, and <span class="movietitle">Terminator 2</span>, that won ILM two Oscars. Williams and Dippé thought CGI was ready, finally, to become invisible. But Dennis Muren, ILM’s VFX Supervisor, wasn’t so sure. He also didn’t want to venture in the direction of poaching a high-profile contract from a friend and colleague.</p>

	<figure>
					<img src="../full/gifs/d18.gif">
				</figure>

				<p>Working in secret, Williams built a T-Rex skeleton from scratch—the same method he’d used for the T-1000. By November ‘91, he’d given it a walk cycle, in time for an anticipated visit by Amblin producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. He kept it playing on a monitor where they couldn’t help but notice it. To Kennedy, “it was immediately very clear that we were going to get realistic movement to these dinosaurs that was going to be far advanced from what we were doing with stop motion.” They commissioned further tests.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>First, ILM delivered a demo of a herd of running gallimimus skeletons. Spielberg was astonished. The footage reminded him of National Geographic. “I looked at it and I couldn’t speak after watching it. I just couldn’t even catch my breath. I had never seen anything like it. Because even though it was just a skeletal frame of Gallimimus, this herd of Gallimimus was moving just as realistically as if we had taken a camera and filmed them for real.”</p>

				<p>But he needed to see a T-Rex walking in broad daylight before he could be sure. The engineers at ILM made 3D scans of the dinosaur models to make matching digital versions. That highly anticipated test was screened for Spielberg, Kennedy, Marshall, Tippett, and Lucas, among others.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Everyone who was there to see it says they felt like they were witnessing the dawn of a new age. A computer generated entity passing for real.</p>
				<p>As Lucas said:</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Everyone had tears in their eyes. It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call. A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.</p>
				</div>

				</figure>

				<p>As the story goes, Tippett declared himself “extinct,” although he was soon brought back into the fold as the dinosaur motion supervisor.</p>
				<p>Spielberg took the frisson of this world-historic moment and fed it back into the story.</p>
				<p>We can track this development in the changes that happened to the story between the first draft—developed with Michael Crichton and others through 1990 and 1991, <em>before</em> the decision to use CGI—and the final draft, developed with David Koepp through 1992.</p>

				<p>In October ‘89, Spielberg was chatting with Michael Crichton in his office about another project, when he found out about Crichton’s latest book, <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>, which Crichton had just delivered to his publisher. Crichton had written a screenplay about a graduate student cloning a pterodactyl from fossil DNA in 1983, but required several years to work out the kinks. Spielberg asked to read it, and the next day the two agreed they wanted to make it together. But in May 1990, as the book was getting ready for print, Crichton’s agents started a bidding war. Spielberg went to Universal Studios, to secure the funding, emphasizing the property’s franchising and theme park potential. They were especially interested in the T-Rex river chase.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d049.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>In addition to $1.5 million, Crichton was paid $500,000 to write the first draft of the screenplay. He was sick of the dinosaurs and the characters at that point, but Spielberg said that they needed somebody to pare it down, fast. Crichton said he’d do it, with the provision that he’d eventually hand it off for someone else for the character polishes. He got started in July 1990, even before the book was released.</p>
				<p>Crichton delivered his first draft seven weeks later, on September 7th, 1990. Although this draft has never been published, in 2022, archivist Derrick Davis <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/michael-crichtons-jp-novel-to-screen">summarized</a> its contents. By Spielberg’s request, and Crichton’s intention, the first draft is a straightforward adaptation that <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/michael-crichtons-jp-novel-to-screen">“has all the big scenes retained and has the logical flow that appears in the much longer and more extended argument.”</a> It succeeded in establishing the general outline that would be used in the finished movie.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Grant, at the dig, is approached by Hammond or a representative   </li>
					<li>Grant and Sattler meet the kids  </li>
					<li>They fly to Isla Nublar  </li>
					<li>They encounter the sauropods for the first time   </li>
					<li>They get settled and head to the Visitor’s Centre  </li>
					<li>They go to the theater, then to the genetics lab (the extraction lab, the fertilization lab, the hatchery, and the nursery) and then to the control room. Hammond defends the park against the critics  </li>
					<li>There’s a scene at the raptor pen  </li>
					<li>The group goes on a guided tour of the park as Hammond watches from the control room  </li>
					<li>They stop to inspect a sick dinosaur and Sattler stays behind   </li>
					<li>Nedry steps away, turns off the power, and runs off with the DNA  </li>
					<li>The T-Rex breaks out of the fence and attacks the stalled cars  </li>
					<li>The man riding with the kids runs out and is killed, and Malcolm is injured  </li>
					<li>Grant and the children must evade the T-Rex as they make their way back to the Visitor’s Centre (initially including a river-rafting chase scene) while the rest of the group tries to recover them and debates how to restore the power.  </li>
					<li>Once Grant and the kids return,
						<ul>
							<li>Tim and Lex are chased by raptors into the kitchen,  </li>
							<li>Ellie and Muldoon distract the raptors outside,  </li>
							<li>Someone resets the power  </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>One of the kids gets the computers back on in the Control Room  </li>
					<li>There’s a showdown in the rotunda involving the T-Rex skeleton  </li>
					<li>Hammond meets his fate  </li>
					<li>They escape by helicopter</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Spielberg wasn’t satisfied with it. He said that it “start[ed] too fast.” The next draft included a prologue, and pushed back the scene where the visitors first see the sauropods, delaying the gratification of seeing the ‘monsters,’ like in <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>. Crichton turned in his final ‘chunk’ on January 19th, 1991, and said he had taken his <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/06/JURASSIC-PARK-01-19-1991-Crichton-Re-Type.pdf">best shot</a>.</p>
				<p>The plot was still rough around the edges. But besides that, Crichton’s draft had flat characters, weak laughs, and lacked inspiration, failing to punctuate its emotional moments.</p>
				<p>Spielberg began shooting on <span class="movietitle">Hook</span> on February 19th, 1991, which ran overschedule and budget, occupying his attention until June. Soon after starting, Maria Scotch Marmo, who had just successfully reworked the character of Captain Hook, was enlisted to work on <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>. She found out from her husband that Amblin had optioned Crichton’s novel; she got a copy and was reading it outside the studio one day, when Kennedy noticed, started a conversation, and invited Marmo to try a rewrite. Marmo and Spielberg talked a lot about the story while shooting the movie, but Marmo only officially started her draft in October, and only finished it on <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/05/JurassicPark-FirstDraft.txt">March 14th, 1992</a>.</p>
				<p>Although Marmo read Crichton’s draft, she decided to start fresh and work from the novel. She said her principal contribution was to make Sattler and the children more assertive. Crichton had prioritized scientific verisimilitude, as he had in the book, but Spielberg said that “effects are only as good as the audience’s feeling for the characters.”</p>
				<p>Marmo also brought out the romantic comedy and “mating ritual” between Grant and Sattler, who’d already been married in Carter’s version. <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> gained much of its colour during her tenure. But overall her take was too juvenile. Spielberg said, simply, “I’ve read it twice, and I think it’s a miss.”</p>
				<p>At this point, Koepp was brought on from Robert Zemeckis’ <span class="movietitle">Death Becomes Her</span> (1992), and quickly pulled the script into shape in time for the production’s August start date. Koepp never even read the previous drafts.</p>
				<p>So goes the surface history of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>. But a closer look, aided by other materials unearthed by Davis, including early storyboards, story memos, and a lost draft by Production Designer Rick Carter (<span class="movietitle">Back to the Future Part II</span>), suggest a far more continuous development largely governed by Spielberg himself.</p>
				<p>When Crichton first met with Spielberg to discuss the script, Crichton had expected they would talk about dinosaurs. Instead <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Steven-Spielberg-Biography-Joseph-McBride/dp/1604738367">recalled Crichton</a>:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>as I scribbled hastily, he went through every character in the story, outlining their physical appearances, their motivations, their hopes and fears, their quirks and foibles. Ideas about dialogue, gestures, and costuming tumbled out. Speaking very rapidly, he went on like this for an hour.</p>
				</div>

				<p>This sort of creative “fugue state” is typical of Spielberg’s collaborations with his writers.</p>
				<p>Carter:</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>On most shows, the production designer is brought in and handed a script and asked to visualize it. Not so on this one. I was in on many early meetings with Steven where we would break down the scenes in the book and discuss which ones would work best for the film.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>Marmo:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>Usually writers get an assignment, go home, write it, and turn it in. We didn't work that way. I had feedback from Steven all the time. In fact, I would send him my first fifteen pages and he would react to them. Then I’d rewrite them a little in accordance with his wishes and send them back with the next fifteen pages, so he would have thirty. And that was pretty much the process for the whole five-month period.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Koepp:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>I had a collaborator who was absolutely gushing with ideas. It was more a case of me managing the firehose of good ideas that were directed at me.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Jim V. Hart, the original screenwriter for <span class="movietitle">Hook</span>, said that, “Steven tends to use writers like paintbrushes. He wants this writer for this, this writer for that.” </p>
				<p>Months before his first script meeting with Crichton in July ‘90, Spielberg was already working out the story. He’d pored through his copy of the book, highlighting his favourite passages and scribbling notes in the margins. What I wanted to do,” Spielberg said, “was boil the book down and choose my seven or eight favorite scenes and base the script around those. So we crunched the book.”</p>
				<p>Carter was the first creative professional brought onto the project, within weeks of acquiring the property. They hired seven artists to help conceptualize the story: five primarily doing storyboards (Marty Kline, Ed Varreaux, Tom Cranham, Dave Lowry, John Bell) and two primarily doing paintings (Dave Negron, and Craig Mullens).</p>

					<img src="../full/pics/d051.png">
				</figure>

				<p>After they crunched the book and established its major setpieces, Spielberg started to dig in.</p>
				<p>According to <a href="../full/mp3s/01.mp3">Lowry</a>:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>The thing about a Steven movie is that Steven storyboards it first. And they carve out time for him to be able to sit and draw his rough thumbnails, and then our job becomes interpreting and re-drawing it as illustrators do, making them prettier drawings. But the bulk of—99% of—the shot ideas and the action, the schtick—I mean a lot of it’s in the script of course, it’s written as part of the story, all that happens—but the <em>visualizing</em> of it, and the making of those Spielberg moments is all Steven. And I mean, he’s a genius. Stan Winston said, ‘it’s no coincidence that Steven Spielberg is Steven Spielberg’. So for all those years with Steven, those were really great meetings. It would just be a couple of us in the room with Steven while he was drawing.</p>
				</div>

				<p>You could see him...—he was really big on drawing a sequence of drawings. The same shot going on for A, B, C, D, E, F—that many frames describing the action as it goes, and you’d sort of watch it as he was drawing it, as he was seeing it in his mind’s eye, and it would be pretty cool, because they’d be Steven moments. And then it would get to the end and you’d wait for the kicker. And he’d pause and he’d look off, and you’d realize that... at first you’re thinking “oh he already thought this up so far, so that’s why it’s coming out so easy.” And then you realize he’s making it up as he goes, and he thinks of the kicker for the end of the scene, and you’d think ‘that’s so great, that’s wonderful.’</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d052.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>Carter observed that Spielberg begins by envisioning a physical layout: “once he knows what the space is—that's very important, to know where things are—he'll just start playing a projector in his head. He’s open to contributions, and he’ll talk it through, but he'll actually draw these funny little frames which are incredibly detailed if you know how to look at them.</p>

				<p>These are a few of Spielberg’s “funny little frames” from <span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span> (1981). Very few are published.</p>

					<img src="../full/pics/d055.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Koepp would later say he found the storyboards “enormously helpful. It was like having a large portion of the movie just handed to you, to be able to walk around and soak up the feel of what the movie’s supposed to be like.”</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d056.jpg"><figcaption>One of the setpieces stood above the rest: the main road T-Rex attack, a central story moment presenting key problems for the Visual Effects department. Early concept art by Craig Mullens.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d057.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Carter writes (above) that Spielberg not only approved but “designed” this scene.</p>

				<p>By the time this sequence got to Koepp, it had already been locked. “I was handed a pile of storyboards. [...] The visual sequence was <em>done</em>, I just typed it up. And I got a very nice compliment, he said, “boy, that action is all so well-described.” (podcast)</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d058.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Some of the recently published storyboards appear to have been produced prior to Crichton’s first draft.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d059.png">
				</figure>

				<p>In this frame, for example, we see an older Tim (11) and a younger Lex (7 or 8). These were their ages in the novel, and they were only reversed with Koepp’s draft, since Spielberg wanted Joseph Mazzelo as a younger Tim, and “realized that if I cast Lex younger than Tim, she would look about five years old—which was much too young to put in jeopardy with these dinosaurs. It would have turned the audience against us completely.”</p>
				<p>But here Lex is drawn with dark hair, while in Crichton’s novel (earlier) and his drafts (later) she’s described as a blonde. She’s also holding a doll, rather than the baseball mitt has in Crichton’s novel and both of his drafts. No accessory is mentioned in Carter’s version, and by Marmo’s it’s a flashlight instead.</p>
				<p>By Crichton’s first draft, the kids are described as being protected from the invading T-rex by a plastic bubble that “falls over them like a shield.”</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d060.png">
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d061.png">
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<a href="../full/mp4s/04_Bubble_compressed.mp4"><img src="../full/pics/d062.png"></a>
					<figurecaption>Spielberg explains this moment in an early production meeting: “Well, the prologue is where it eats the skylight... the big plexi comes out, and it actually protects the kids in a plastic bubble, but it frustrates the Rex who’s trying to get his mouth around the kids, but he’s got this plastic bubble in his way, he goes right through the top of the car, he leaves, the whole roof is just a big plastic bubble, it can just go inside the car and encapsulate them.”</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Afterwards, the T-Rex lifts the car into her jaws, attempting to eat the children alive. Lex falls out of the car into the mud, still holding her doll. Unlike in the book, however, she lands just underfoot of the T-Rex.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d063.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Crichton’s first draft introduces more mutilation than exists in the corresponding scenes in the book. In the first draft, and only the first draft, The T. Rex is described as chomping down on Malcolm’s legs, and then pinning Ed Regis (a deleted tour guide character) into the mud with her claws. Then, according to Davis’ summary: “The rex grabs him in his jaws, and lifts him above the limbs of the tree. We don't see what happens. Body parts seem to fall, but it's hard to tell in darkness.” Then the gore showers onto Grant and the kids below. </p>
				<p>In Crichton’s second draft, Nedry’s body is discovered ripped into parts. </p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d064.png">

				<p>In Marmo’s, the dismemberment is expressed as comic relief.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d065.png">
					<figcaption></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Even before finishing his first draft, Crichton was told to drop the Pterodactyl scene that had made the initial crunch. It was eventually used in <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park 3</span>.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Finally, Crichton’s first draft contains a new ending. In the book, Hammond stumbles into a ravine, and is eaten alive by ‘compys’, small dinosaurs with narcotic venom.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d067.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>In Crichton’s first draft, this happens instead in the rotunda, after the hanging dinosaur skeleton and scaffolding crashes down onto him, pinning him to the ground.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d068.png">
				</figure>
				
				<p>In general, the drafts of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> are rife with practical effects set-pieces collapsing along the vertical axis, replaying the dynamics of the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> accident from various points of view. Generally: a man, boy, and girl engaged by a powerful ‘force’ from above (with special priority to the height of approx. 24-feet). These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The helicopter descending onto a jungle clinic (novel; Carter; Koepp1)  </li>
					<li>The helicopter descending onto the dig site (Crichton2; Carter; all Koepp)  </li>
					<li>The helicopter’s turbulent descent onto Isla Nublar (all versions)  </li>
					<li>The T-Rex attacks the car, with Lex and Tim inside (all versions; in Koepp they are “pinned” to their seats).  </li>
					<li>The T-Rex lifting and dropping the car with Tim and Lex inside (novel through Carter; afterwards, the Rex just rolls the car, in Koepp’s Tim is “pinned” to the ground)  </li>
					<li>The T-Rex pushing the car over the ledge, with Grant and Lex hanging on below (Marmo and all subsequent versions)  </li>
					<li>Grant and Tim climbing down the tree, avoiding being crushed by the car (all versions)  </li>
					<li>Grant and the kids avoid swooping pterodactyls in the aviary (novel; removed during Crichton’s first draft)  </li>
					<li>Grant and the kids climb the electric fence (Marmo and all subsequent versions)  </li>
					<li>T-Rex attack during river rafting (removed with Koepp’s first draft; in Carter’s the raft is “pinned” by a falling tree)  </li>
					<li>Skeleton collapses in the Visitor’s Centre, “pinning” Hammond, Tim, or raptors to the ground variously (Crichton’s first draft and on)  </li>
					<li>T-Rex attacks the escaping helicopter (Carter, Marmo)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This dynamic also exists in optimistic or wish-fulfilled versions, such as the beatific vision of the brachiosaurs, or the elevation to safety in the trees, or the final escape by helicopter.</p>
				<p>Crichton turned in his second draft on January 19th, ‘91. 3 days later, Spielberg, Carter, and Steve Starkey met to discuss the script with an eye to reducing the budget. And 6 weeks later, Carter turned in a draft of his own.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d069.png">
				</figure>

				<p>While each of Spielberg’s writers attests to his close involvement, his exact influence is obscured by their product. Carter’s draft—a “collage” of notes and storyboards that claims mostly to reflect the state of the story pre-<span class="movietitle">Hook</span>—suggests a more transparent view into Spielberg’s vision for <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> as it existed after Crichton and before Marmo.</p>

				<p>Carter’s version is the only one bookended by helicopter scenes, beginning with the In-Gen helicopter, and ending with a military helicopter.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d070.png">

					<img src="../full/pics/d071.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Carter’s opening adapts the prologue from the book, in which some of Hammond’s men deliver an injured worker to a jungle clinic. Ed Regis tells the doctor that the worker was injured in a construction accident and mentions a “backhoe” but she suspects that he was mauled. In a line not in the book, she conveys her doubt by remarking that “it looks like he was eaten by a bulldozer.” The patient moans “lo sa raptor” before dying and then Carter cuts from the bite marks to the raptor jaws Grant is uncovering. The association between industrial machines and dinosaurs is echoed later on in a description that says that a trail deforested by dinosaurs looks like a “giant bulldozer went berserk.”</p>

				</figure>


<figure>
				<img src="../full/pics/d074.png"></figure>

			<p>	Marmo’s draft introduces a similar analogy, this time between the helicopter and the dinosaurs, during the Nublar landing scene. (Marmo’s analogy is ambivalent—it’s difficult to entirely distinguish whether it refers to a T-Rex, a velociraptor, or some hybrid with a mosquito or a dragonfly. As a symbol, then, it reflects Freud’s principle of condensation.)</p>

				<figure>
					<a href="../full/mp4s/d15.mp4"><img src="../full/pics/d075.png"></a>
					<figcaption>The courtroom returns to Indian Dunes.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>In Koepp’s first draft (the only other version to contain the helicopter opening)—as in the book—the doctor looks up the definition of “raptor” and learns that it means “bird of prey.” Then, in Koepp’s early versions of the dig scene, the ROAR of the arriving helicopter is described as sounding “like some giant beast descending on the camp.” But Koepp also retains the bulldozer; he opens with a newly imagined scene that shows the accident itself, when a bulldozer, which also ROARS, attempts to push a crate into a holding pen, and an attending worker is slashed by whatever’s inside.</p>
				<p>In Crichton’s second draft, the lawyer that approaches from the helicopter is told that he’s standing on top of the skeleton. In Carter’s version, the helicopter lands “right on top of the dig site.” In Koepp’s early versions, the helicopter arrives at night. Grant “looks up at the helicopter and shouts, shaking his first.”</p>
				<p>In Carter’s version (only), during the Nublar helicopter descent, when the pilot loses control, Ellie asks Hammond if they’re going to crash. In Crichton’s second draft (only), it’s Lex who asks. In Marmo’s version (only) the helicopter is twice described as shaking violently.</p>
	
				<figure>
					<img src="../full/pics/d076.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Carter’s draft closes by introducing the new “T-rex finale” that “came from Spielberg’s fertile mind” during the January 22nd ‘91 story meeting. In previous versions, the park had either been blown up by an army helicopter in a series of fiery explosions (Crichton’s first version) or destroyed by a genetically-engineered lysine deficiency akin to a plague (Crichton’s second).</p>

				<p>This version lasts through Marmo’s draft (in which it becomes an “army helicopter”), but is gone by Koepp’s: “I was not privy to that one. Steven must have moved on from that one before I got there.”</p>
				<p>On Marmo’s request, Spielberg lent her his personal copy of the galleys, with highlights and margin notes. She also stayed in touch with Crichton. Her version includes a description of a bearded Grant, and storyboards from this era feature Grant with glasses, an Asian Ellie (although Marmo is quoted as saying she pushed for Dern as Ellie), and the dark-haired Lex.</p>

				<p>By the time Marmo finished her script, Koepp had already been given his assignment and Spielberg’s full attention. He decided to start fresh from the novel rather than modifying earlier drafts. But he worked from the copious storyboards and ideas generated by the creative team in conjunction with the previous screenwriters and Spielberg. As well, during the writing, he received story notes from Marmo, and ongoing input from Spielberg, whom he found to have “wonderful suggestions for action scenes.”</p>
				<p>Spielberg had emphasized to Marmo that each scene should be “weighty with narrative ingenuity,” and Koepp continued the process of compressing the story. He refined the movie’s pairs of opposites, such as chaos-order, nature-artifice, man-woman, parent-child, science-religion, carnivore-herbivore, creator-creation, etc.</p>

					<p>The kids were kind of a challenge, because we didn’t want it to seem like they were there just to have kids in the movie. Steven, in particular, is vulnerable to criticism like that, because he likes to work with kids. He works with kids awfully well, so it’s not entirely fair, but the perception is there nonetheless. So our challenge was to find out  why these kids were essential to the movie. (Koepp, qtd. in <a href="https://archive.org/embed/makingofjurassic00shay">Shay</a> 57)</p>

				<p>Koepp turned in an early <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p43QNiLaMC6B4ZqEn6bL9dfRyuHCA3on/preview">working draft</a> sometime between April 23rd and May 1st, 1992; a draft on May 26th, of which only <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2781141168611237&type=3">10 pages</a> have been released; an update on June 30th (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1462818743776826&type=3">full script</a>); followed by numerous revisions during principal photography, with a Final Shooting Script dated <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFPTKCbNCldFvg4eNWpW_UONPZAb54EQ/preview">November 11th</a> and a Final Draft dated <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/05/JurassicPark-Final.pdf">December 11th, 1992</a>.</p>
				<p>Koepp’s version, like all previous versions but Marmo’s, expands on a moment of criminal negligence from Crichton’s novel. The novel includes three separate dinosaur incidents on mainland Costa Rica: (1) the arrival by helicopter of a young (“no older than 18”) injured worker to a jungle clinic; (2) the attack of a young girl by compys (later used in <span class="movietitle">The Lost World</span>); and (3) a fatal attack on an infant by compys while a nanny is distracted. Eventually word of the strange lizards is funneled to Columbia University, where it’s redirected to Dr. Grant for his expert opinion. This coincides with the arrival of Grant’s research funder, Hammond, whom Grant has been informed has been buying up amber. Later in the movie, Grant spies baby velociraptors stowing away on the supply ship. Besides Crichton’s second draft, which includes the second incident (a scene discarded within days), the drafts focus on the first incident. </p>
				<p>Koepp’s first draft drops the idea of the raptors already having made it to the mainland, but opens for the first time with the “bulldozer accident.” He then reintroduces Carter’s jungle clinic scene, including Crichton’s beat of the doctor learning that a “raptor” is a “bird of prey.” And he continues with a scene at an amber mine, first conceived in Marmo, but now with Hammond learning that the injured worker is suing them for $2 million dollars. In every subsequent version this is adjusted to $20 million. By the May version, Koepp and Spielberg realized that the jungle clinic beat was just a rehash of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>’ “this is not a boat accident.” They omitted it, but allowed the original accident to remain as a catalyst for the investors to pressure Hammond, who must then court Grant’s approval to smooth over the disturbance.</p>
				<p>Koepp’s crucial tweak was making Dr. Grant hostile towards children, creating a dramatic tension that doesn’t exist in the novel or previous versions. Grant uses his prop claw (introduced in Crichton’s second draft) to slash at and terrorize a child—already re-enacting the opening scene. (Critic Henry Sheehan finds this moment to be echoed again in the main road T-Rex attack, in which Grant interrupts his own “(barely) suppressed murder fantasy” by snapping out of a trancelike moment of indecision.)</p>
				<p>Koepp finally removed the raft sequence, which he found “rather redundant.” The Jurassic Park River Adventure at Universal Studios had been being developed since at least May 1990. Spielberg <a href="https://youtu.be/TJmn5UUbYss?si=JNOegpuHJGwEl3rK&t=1335">called</a> it “a three-dimensional chance to live the movie,” although he admitted he would be stepping out before the steep drop at the end, being, himself, afraid of heights.</p>
				<p>Koepp also continued to develop the ending. Each draft since Crichton’s first develops a scene involving the collapse of the T-Rex skeleton in the rotunda (not in the book). In Crichton’s first draft, we recall, it collapsed onto Hammond. In his second, it collapses as Grant climbs it, and serves as a distraction. In Carter’s, Tim and Lex try to escape the raptors by climbing into the T-Rex’s rib cage, to no avail; Grant arrives at the last minute, presses some control buttons, which causes the skeleton to collapse, with the T-Rex skull crushing one of the raptors. Marmo’s version is similar. Koepp’s refines the concept further, introducing a ‘Condor’ crane that Grant maneuvers to knock down the skeleton, ripping it from the ceiling and sending cables and bolts down like bullets, and with the skull decapitating the raptor—beheading the raptor with a beheaded head. (cf. Aristotle, Poetics 13.1452a)</p>

				<p>In the final draft (the change was only made on-set) the skeleton collapses on top of Tim—marking the third time that a chassis has done so, a conspicuous repetition.</p>

				<p>Koepp also completes the rehabilitation of John Hammond. After Hammond was crushed in Crichton’s first draft, he distracts the raptors in the second, sacrificing himself in a final act of redemption to save the kids.</p>

					<figcaption></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Carter’s version is similar, except that Hammond admits to knowing the DNA was unstable and that the park was never tenable. In Marmo, he admits it but blames it on his employees, and is left behind and dies. In Koepp’s first draft, he admits he knew, but blames it on himself, and stays behind but we don’t see him die. By Koepp’s June 30th ‘92 draft, the DNA isn’t inherently unstable, Hammond’s culpability for the park and bringing the kids there is unclear, and he is brought along on the helicopter. Koepp <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/script-apart/id1518622561?i=1000616197924">speaks</a> to the softening of Hammond directly: “Steven identified with him, whether consciously or not.” </p>
				<p>Marmo said, “I thought [Hammond] was insane because he made a park that had raptors and T. rexes in it and still he brought his grandchildren to it before it had a real safety check. He took his own grandchildren to a potentially lethal park to use them as pawns.” But, “Steven wanted a sunnier captain of the Jurassic ship; he was clear about that.”</p>
				<p>By the final draft, the question of culpability for the story’s concrete acts of negligence—the young worker mauled by a raptor whose family is suing Hammond for 2 or 20 million dollars; the boy and girl repeatedly threatened with violent death—is overshadowed by Hammond’s idealism and the ultimate rescue of the children.</p>
				<p>But Koepp’s versions also enact a more fundamental reframing. In the book, Dr. Wu compares DNA to photography: “The DNA of the dinosaurs was like old photographs that had been retouched, basically the same as the original but in some places repaired and clarified...” (137). The analogy begun in the textual form of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> the book only comes to full reflexivity in <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> the movie which is, of course, a sequence of hundreds of thousands of retouched “old photographs.” Koepp’s draft marks the arrival of a meta-consciousness concerning not only the movie’s own character as a theme park attraction, but as a state of the art technology demonstration.</p>
				<p>Reconstituting the components of the miracle at ILM, Koepp’s first draft restores the early brachiosaurus scene from Crichton’s first draft and sequences it next to the movie theatre/computer lab/genetic nursery, amalgamated into a single rotating theme park ride.</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>I’d love to take credit for it, but I think it was Steven’s idea. It was brilliant. We could pop in for a few seconds here and there, put up some essential bits of information, and then get out. ... <em>and</em> it would make sense because it’s all part of the amusement park environment. ...</p>
				</div>

				<p>But, Koepp continues:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>It was funny, but it was getting into a pretty weird area. Here I was writing about these greedy people who are creating a fabulous theme park just so they can exploit all these dinosaurs and make silly films and sell stupid plastic plates and things. And I’m writing it for a company that’s eventually going to put this in their theme parks and make silly little films and sell stupid plastic plates. I was really chasing my tail there for a while trying to figure out who was virtuous in the whole scenario—and eventually gave up.</p>
				</div>

				<p>This conscious, ironic meta-reference became the finishing layer of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s aesthetic.</p>

				<figure>
					<a href="../full/mp4s/d16.mp4"><img src="../full/pics/d097.png"></a>
				</figure>

				<p>Spielberg was dreaming himself into his movies—as he always did—but had intuited a strange new hook. It was a dream about discovering a new power for making dreams come true—just as, in reality, he was.</p>

				<p>Throughout the story, they remind the spectator of their newly harnessed powers for capturing the imagination. As critic Nigel Morris puts it:
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p><span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> inflects knowledge, always present in spectatorship, that what is experienced is not real—though the experience is real and what is experienced may be realistic—by heightened awareness of the stimuli’s synthetic nature.

				<p>This shifting was both cause and effect, a mesmerizing feedback loop that bounded the spectator’s sense of being both safely protected behind a screen and completely enveloped in the story.</p>

				<a id="section-18"></a><h3>#18. <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> (2022) is About the Limits of Honesty</h3>
				
				<p>Spielberg’s most comprehensive biography to date is Joseph McBride’s <span class="booktitle">Steven Spielberg: A Biography</span>, first published in 1997. But it was “unauthorized”. Spielberg has always discouraged potential biographers, telling them that he was planning to write his own autobiography at some time in the future.</p>
				<p>McBride notes Spielberg’s desire to “control the telling of his own life story.” He writes:</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>I am constantly surprised by how many people, including some in the literary world, react with automatic suspicion when they hear the phrase "unauthorized biography," as if there were something inherently dubious about a book not having the subject's seal of approval. On the contrary, what should arouse the reader's suspicions are the inevitable constraints placed on an author's integrity by the decision to allow his subject to authorize and thereby to control the writing of the book. By talking endlessly about his life in press and television interviews to promote his movies, Spielberg already has given us an autobiography of sorts, albeit a scattered, fragmentary, and sometimes misleading one; what largely has been missing from the picture is an independent examination of his character, seen not simply through his eyes alone but also through the perspectives of the people who have known and worked with him throughout his lifetime.</p>
				</div>
			
				<p>McBride details some of these “misleads” in his work. Spielberg has a habit of telling “fibs”. Most famously over the years, for example, he’s told various more-or-less elaborate versions of how he got his break at Universal Studios. The template is that he sneaks off a tour, hides in the bathroom, and then occupies an office and gradually insinuates himself into the studio. The truth (which is no less impressive) is that his father’s colleague contacted the Universal Studios librarian, Chuck Silvers, who got Spielberg a day-pass and offered to show him around. Spielberg made a strong impression on him, and Silvers offered him a summer internship, but couldn’t get him a pass, and so Spielberg had to find his own way onto the lot.*</p>
				<p>It may seem trifling to address such imprecisions, but many of these fibs sustain a weird purchase in reality. In 1970, Spielberg subtracted a year from his age, an adjustment he maintained in the media and on government documents, like his driver’s licence, until 1995 (past the time of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>) when it was only corrected as the result of a lawsuit. In 1975, his adjusted age allowed him to void an unfavourable contract on the basis that he’d signed it before he was 21. It was only after McBride sought out Spielberg’s birth certificate and published the history of the claims that the counter-party was able to settle their valid legal dispute.</p>
				<p>Spielberg started making good on his promise of an autobiography as early as 2002, with <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span>. Of course, as we have seen, Spielberg’s work generally has a strong autobiographical tendency. But <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span> signalled a “more literal” reflection of his own family trauma. (<strong>McBride?)</strong></p>
				<p>Despite his frequently told anecdote suggesting his lack of susceptibility to Freudian analysis, he also began to admit the opposite. In conversation with Scorsese about the film at the time of its release, Spielberg noted that:</p>
			
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>The older I get, the more I go back to the early memories to get me to commit to a movie. It takes sometimes something very Freudian to get me to say, 'Well, this is interesting; I better read beyond page fifty.'"</p>
				</div>

				<p>In 2017, HBO produced <em>Spielberg</em>’s first authorized biography: <span class="movietitle">Spielberg</span> (2017). Spielberg’s mother, Leah Adler, encouraged him to turn it into a movie.</p>
				<p>Spielberg has always been fascinated by coming-of-age stories, but in 2022, with <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> he finally turns the lens onto himself—still displacing his story onto fictional characters but to the minimal degree. And it’s precisely by undermining this apparent transparency that he begins to reveal the distortions that characterize his technique.</p>
				<p>In an interview with director Paul Thomas Anderson, Spielberg once again describes his working relationship with screenwriter Tony Kushner as a sort of therapy session, acknowledging his first (but not his second) therapy experience.*</p>
				<p><em>The Fabelmans</em> begins like Bergman’s <span class="movietitle">Scenes from a Marriage</span>—a 1973 6-part TV series about the disintegration of a marriage—before finding its shape or “splitting” as Paul Thomas Anderson puts it.</p>
				<p>Spielberg has previously used <span class="movietitle">Scenes from a Marriage</span> as a shorthand for the difference between him (and George Lucas) and Scorsese (and the rest of New Hollywood). One style he says, is introspective, and “concentric” while the other is a “complete thought” and “more linear.”</p>
				<p>The story unfolds in the vein of Malick’s <span class="movietitle">Tree of Life</span> or Tarkovsky’s <span class="movietitle">Mirror</span>. Spielberg mythologizes his own biography as a genesis of myth-making, turning the particulars of his life—like having three younger sisters, being a Jew among Christians, and the child of an unstable marriage—into elements of a paradigmatic creation myth populated by the gods and goddesses of cinema. </p>
				<p>The movie opens with one of Spielberg’s earliest memories: his mother and father taking him to the movies.</p>
				<p>His parents are emblems of the Greatest Generation; his mother is a creative spirit playing the role of a housewife, and his father is an engineer laying the foundations of the personal computer.</p>
				<p>When describing the memory elsewhere, Spielberg emphasizes two impressions: feeling overwhelmed and feeling deceived.</p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>So the curtain is open and I expect to see the elephants and there's nothing but a flat piece of white cardboard, a canvas. And I look at the canvas and suddenly a movie comes on and it's <span class="movietitle">The Greatest Show on Earth</span>. At first I was so disappointed, I was angry at my father, he told me he was taking me to a circus and it's just this flat piece of color. [...] For a while I kept thinking, Gee, that's not fair, I wanted to see three-dimensional characters and all this was was flat shadows, flat surfaces. I was disappointed by everything after that. I didn't trust anybody. I never felt life was good enough, so I had to embellish it.</p>
				</div>

				<p>But in <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> this moment is played for awe. It’s superimposed over another, more primal memory, which he described to <span class="booktitle">Time</span> magazine in 1985: being wheeled down the aisle of a synagogue towards the red light of the Ark of the Torah, while elders on each side chanted prayers in rhythm and handed him crackers. And when asked in 1991 to choose a “master image” that recurs throughout his work, Spielberg chose that of Barry, the toddler from <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, approaching “that beautiful but awful light, just like fire.” Spielberg’s first memory is also his “master image,” and here he layers it under the later memory, rendering the cinematic image as the penultimate expression of the divine fire.</p>
				<p>These two memories give way to a third: inspired by the train crash in the middle of <span class="movietitle">The Greatest Show on Earth</span>, Spielberg begins to crash his own trains together by flashlight.</p>
				<p>His mother reflects on the artistic fulfillment she feels while playing Bach, especially when she descends into the lower octave of one of his laments, describing it as "making a world you can be safe and happy in,” and infers from this that crashing trains is her son’s way of gaining a sense of control over his life. His father isn’t conscious of it, but he takes just as much pleasure in tinkering with his machines.*</p>
				<p>The subsequent scene plays like Freudian pornography (clip). And later, when the family goes camping just after he turns 16, his mother dances in a nightgown as the men of the family gaze on. His father’s best friend tells Sammy that he should be filming this, and turns on the headlights of the car behind her, making her gown transparent. Once again the illuminated moving image is infused with ambivalence. The embarrassed elder daughter tries to block her, but Sammy urges her to sit down, which the father doesn’t overrule.</p>
				<p>Later, while editing the dancing footage on his father’s request, he notices evidence of his mother having an affair with the friend. This is the moment that gives the movie its “shape,” echoing the earlier “secret,” and splitting Sammy from the rest of his family.</p>
				<p>Sammy and his mother, as co-conspirators, play out an emotional affair in parallel to her actual affair, which eventually results in the family’s divorce. Spielberg had been accused of making Disney movies about incest before, with <span class="movietitle">The Colour Purple</span> and <span class="movietitle">Back to the Future</span>, and now the veil is even further lifted.</p>
				<p>As Jocasta says to Oedipus in Sophocles’ tragedy, “many a man has slept with his own mother in a dream.”</p>
				<p>But even when the movie’s psychosexual elements are made explicit, they hardly register until they become so loud that they’re hard to ignore. Once young Steven reaches senior year in Saratoga, his power to control reality becomes activated, not only within the story, but conspicuously in its telling.</p>
				<p>After being bullied by two blonde antisemites, Sammy later finds himself in a private, playful moment in the library with one of their girlfriends and her friend. When the girlfriend points out that he’s Jewish, he replies, in close-up, “I mean, yeah, since the day I was circumcised.” The friend becomes attracted to him, associating him with Jesus (who was also Jewish, and circumcised), and invites him over to her room, covered in posters of Jesus and Elvis, so that Sammy might let Jesus “come inside him,” the first of many such double entendres.</p>
				<p>Eventually Sammy gets his revenge on the bullies by screening a movie of the senior beach day that he’s edited to show the smaller Aryan as a thieving loser, and the bigger one as an Olympic god, including a close-up of his lower body while running. The bewildered pair turn against each other, and after Sammy admits his exact motives are unclear even to himself, he promises never to tell of the humiliation, “unless I make a movie about it.”</p>
				<p>The autobiography is too Freudian to take at face value. Spielberg is playing with us the same way he says he played with his first therapist. The meta-implication is that Spielberg is showing us what it means to have a power to manipulate reality to make it safer for himself. It was in Saratoga that he realized that his movie camera could be used not only as his vehicle to social acceptance but as a “defensive weapon.”</p>
				<p>Spielberg’s making conspicuous of his power for shaping reality is his way of telling us that there are some things he still can’t talk about even at the sunset of his career.</p>
				
				<a id="section-19"></a><h3>#19. And, as a corollary, all artworks</h3>

				<p>Steven Spielberg’s <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> (1993) recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. In the years since its release, its intellectual property has grown into a “cottage industry,” encompassing theme-park rides, toys, apparel, video games, product placement, and five sequels, with a new “Jurassic era” set to begin in 2025. While Spielberg had already directed other movies that were hugely profitable, some, like <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> (1975), <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> (1977), and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> (1982), weren’t “toyetic,” as Mattel’s CEO once observed about Star Wars back in 1977; and the other, Indiana Jones, belonged to George Lucas. Jurassic Park was the first, and last, enduring merchandising empire that Spielberg could call his own.</p>
				<p>At the time, <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> represented a breakthrough in cinema technology, marking the first time that a blockbuster depended on CGI that looked and moved realistically. It became the herald for the coming digital revolution, which Spielberg talked about with a mixture of excitement, melancholy, and trepidation. <em>(Empire Magazine “<a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/making-jurassic-park/">How Jurassic Park Became the Biggest Movie of all Time</a>” August 1993.)</em></p>
				<p>The filmmakers integrated this energy into Jurassic Park’s brand identity. At the same time as Jurassic Park movies operate at the cutting edge of creative technology, their stories are about the perennial danger of cutting-edge creative technologies, adding a new meta-referential gloss to the classic technology-critical story archetype (e.g., Prometheus, Golem, Frankenstein, Godzilla).</p>
				<p>But <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> also had a more personal significance. By 1992, Spielberg was in his mid-40s and onto his second marriage, with Kate Capshaw, who had just converted to Judaism, renewing Spielberg’s faith in the process. They had one child each from their previous marriages (Max and Jessica), one adopted son (Theo), and two children of their own (Sasha and Sawyer). But he was still facing a transition to adulthood: both in his upcoming responsibilities of running a major Hollywood studio, Dreamworks SKG; and in the seriousness required by <span class="movietitle">Schindler’s List</span> (1993), which was being treated by Sid Sheinberg, Spielberg’s mentor at Universal Studios, as Spielberg’s arrival into his own identity as a mature filmmaker. It was his cinematic bar mitzvah and an emotional breakthrough.</p>
				<p>According to biographer Joseph McBride, Spielberg’s movies of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s reflected the filmmaker working through several of his well-publicized neuroses: his resentments towards his father <span class="movietitle">(Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade)</span>; his divorce to his first wife, Amy Irving (<span class="movietitle">Always</span>); and his own Peter Pan complex (<span class="movietitle">Hook</span>). It was around this time that Spielberg had been trying some psychotherapy. </p>
				
				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>All my friends went to therapy and I thought that maybe I would learn something about myself, so I went for a year. But I can't say that I found the discoveries conclusive. Everything I learned about myself I knew already or I'd guessed for myself.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Spielberg was reportedly in talks with celebrity psychologist John Bradshaw, a guru specializing in healing the inner child, by imaginatively regressing his subject(s) back to their early childhood. According to Bradshaw, Spielberg was deeply impressed by his work. Los Angeles magazine reported that in February of 1992, they met at Spielberg’s house to discuss a TV show Spielberg had been convincing him to do. Bradshaw says, “Steven looked at me on the set of Hook and said, ‘This could be the most powerful television program of all time.’” Spielberg must have valued something about Bradshaw’s analysis, as he hired him as an on-set consultant for Hook, and cast his daughter in the movie.</p>
				<p>In this context, <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> always seemed like one last summer vacation. Sheinberg had insisted Spielberg get <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> done before <span class="movietitle">Schindler’s List</span>: “he knew that once I had directed <span class="movietitle">Schindler,</span> I wouldn't be able to <span class="movietitle">do Jurassic Park."</span></p>
				<p>One critic summed it up as follows:</p>

				<div class="blockquote largequote">
					<p>The paring-down of a monster best-seller into a suspense machine (<span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>); the tackling of a popular-science childhood sense of wonder perennial with state-of-the-art effects that re-imagine 1950s B-science fiction (<span class="movietitle">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span>); the all-action jungle adventure littered with incredible perils and gruesome deaths (<span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>); and big-eyed creatures who range from beatifically benevolent to toothily murderous (<span class="movietitle">Gremlins</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>). (Kim Newman, qtd in Morris, <span class="booktitle">Empire of Light</span>, 256.)</p>
				</div>

				<p>But what if <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> wasn’t a break from Spielberg’s therapeutic phase, but its most pivotal moment?</p>
				
				<figure>
					<a href="../full/mp4s/d21.mp4"><img src="../full/pics/d105.png"></a>
					<figcaption>“But Richard was great for the part because Richard is every person. If I want to put myself in one of my own movies I sort of go to Richard. I feel that I was the ichthyologist in <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> and Richard played me in that; I felt that I was Neary in <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> and Richard played me in that; and I felt I was the character in <span class="movietitle">Always</span> and Richard played me in that also.”</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p><span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> was produced by Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips for Columbia Pictures (with Julia taking the lead, as Michael had taken the lead on <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span>).</p>
				<p>Spielberg had been developing the premise for a while, but Paul Schrader was originally hired to write the screenplay. Spielberg outlined the premise and key images for Schrader, who interpreted it as a retelling of the gospel of St. Paul: an unbeliever has a spiritual encounter that changes the direction of his life. Spielberg hated Schrader’s script (“Kingdom Come”) which he called “one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major studio or director... a terribly guilt-ridden story, not about UFOs at all." </p>
				<p>Schrader said, "The only thing I deserve credit for... is changing Steve's mind about doing the film as a UFO Watergate. I thought it ought to be about a spiritual encounter. That idea stayed and germinated."</p>
				<p>After another rewrite or two by others, Spielberg decided to write the screenplay himself. Spielberg and Phillips honed the idea of a climactic moment of transcendence they referred to as “The Experience.” These pockets of spiritual denouement would become a characteristic feature of Spielberg’s work.</p>
				<p>Kael found <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> to be a “kids’ movie in the best sense.” It was joyous and optimistic. But while she was dazzled by its mixture of the transcendent and the infantile, she was beginning to see Spielberg less in Dreyfuss’ “man looking for answers” and more in the toddler Barry, a “light-worshiper who sees the sky as a giant toy shop.”</p>
				<p>In the wake of <span class="movietitle">Star Wars</span>’ transformation of the cinematic landscape, and the rise of SNL, Spielberg became more assured in dispensing with the pretensions of his New Hollywood milieu and exploring his comedic sensibilities. He was fostering two younger filmmakers, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, who specialized in screwball comedies steeped in American history. He had recommended them to the most conservative of his New Hollywood cohort, John Milius, whose A-Team Productions hired them to develop the script that would become Spielberg’s next movie, <span class="movietitle">1941</span> (1979).</p>
				<p>The foursome began hanging out together, skeet shooting and then going out for chili-burgers and doing bigfoot impressions while Spielberg filmed it all on his Super-8 camera. “Great howling mad evenings... out of which came <span class="movietitle">1941</span>,” said Milius.</p>
				<p><span class="movietitle">1941</span> was the third time in a row that Spielberg had gone over time and budget, but this time it was a bomb. Spielberg soon disavowed the movie, the first of three times, before 1993, that he would do so (<span class="movietitle">Temple of Doom</span> (1984) and <span class="movietitle">Hook</span> (1991) being the other two).</p>
				<p>Spielberg said, “I plunged into [<span class="movietitle">1941</span>] with such wild abandon that I didn’t really focus on the story I was telling, to know whether it was funny or simply stupid or whether the film was getting too overblown... On about the hundred and forty-fifth day of shooting, I realized that the film was directing <em>me</em>, I wasn’t directing <em>it</em>.”</p>
				<p>At the time, he blamed his writers, telling the New York Times that they “caught me at a weak moment. I’ll spend the rest of my life disavowing that movie,” although he apologized to them right after.</p>
				<p>Indiana Jones was first suggested to Spielberg by George Lucas in 1977. Spielberg would direct and Lucas would produce. Lucas negotiated a sweet deal with Paramount (allowing him to keep the rights to the franchise) that was highly contingent  on Spielberg being able to deliver the movie on time and budget.</p>
				<p>He accomplished this with a renewed production regiment, involving an expanded storyboarding practice, newly capable and reliable producers, in Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, and a willingness to shoot to get the job done.</p>
				<p>Spielberg and Lucas jointly worked out the story in a <a href="https://maddogmovies.com/almost/scripts/raidersstoryconference1978.pdf">series of meetings</a> with writer Lawrence Kasden, in which they wrestled over whether the character should be more Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart.</p>
				<p>Both Spielberg and Lucas saw themselves—and each other—in Indiana Jones. Lucas said that “If l could be a dream figure, I'd be Indy,” and Spielberg later <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1py7Yltxvq0wThBrAVWAh7UuNp_5wZ1AF/view?usp=sharing">poked fun</a> at Lucas being “a kind of dweeby Indiana Jones.”</p>

What childhood fantasies of yours were you living out through him?’ ‘Every television show I ever watched from the ages of 2 through I think 12, and every serial I ever saw. Indiana Jones represents the hero that I’ve always wanted to be, and the hero that none of us will ever be within our lifetimes.’”</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Spielberg had come up with the concept for <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> while working on <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<img src="">
					<figcaption>(Clip, 1996) “<span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark... </span> we were shooting that sometime around 1979 or ’80. I remember spending—not a lot of time between shots because I shot <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span> so quickly, there wasn’t a lot of time to think between shots—but there was a particularly long setup and I walked out into the desert. I was picking up prehistoric seashells out there, because certainly the desert part used to be the ocean a long long time ago. Maybe that’s where <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> came from, at least my interest in dinosaurs, I don’t know! But that all was a cousin to turning over seashells and trying to figure out, ‘How can I tell the story of this lonely boy?’ I’m sitting here. I’m a lonely director out in Tunisia, making a Saturday Matinee serial type of movie. I won’t go into my personal life, but I was feeling a bit separate from myself, which often happens when you’re directing. You often go into a fugue state to make a movie. And I was in one of my fugue states, And suddenly, bang, this concept hit me, I knew exactly how to tell the story of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, and the story flooded into my mind, and during the next few days during the shooting of <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> pretty much had a beginning, a middle, and an end.”</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="">
					<figcaption>(Clip, 2002) “I really have always thought that <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> was about the divorce of my mom and dad. And ever since my parents divorced...—I think I was about 16, 17-years old. I had a lot of stories in my mind about how to tell it. And I had this story kicking around about a boy who finds an imaginary friend, in this case it would be an extraterrestrial friend. And that was going to fill his many many needs for the missing father. And it was during shots, on breaks on <span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>, in the desert the whole story began to fill itself in for me. [...] I was desperate for a writer. And I wanted that to be written yesterday. I wanted to pour out all this to somebody and have the person write it all down. True to form it was Indiana Jones who came to the rescue. Harrison Ford’s girlfriend and future wife, screenwriter Melissa Matheson, just happened to be on the set.”</figcaption>

				<p>He <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5l6kkkc2Ex3mFthEyU8iMvI4wGgtqvV/view?usp=sharing">loved</a> her draft (“<span class="movietitle">E.T. and Me</span>”), and they rushed it to production. He had been planning to do <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> next, based on a script called <span class="movietitle">Night Skies</span>, a sort-of sequel to <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly–Hopkinsville_encounter">account</a> that came up in his research about a farmhouse family terrorized by malevolent aliens. He’d hired John Sayles (<span class="movietitle">Piranha</span> (1978), dir. Joe Dante) to turn it into a screenplay, but eventually wrote it himself, incorporating several of his childhood memories. </p>
				<p>At the same time, he’d been wanting to do a movie about children. Spielberg reported that Truffaut had told him: “You must make a movie about keeds. You must stop all this big stuff and make a movie about keeds! If it's the last thing you do!" Spielberg had tasked Gale and Zemeckis with writing the project, but didn’t give them much guidance except that it should be about kids. The three of them worked briefly on a script called <span class="movietitle">After School</span>, but Spielberg’s against advised him against making it—the comedy was too juvenile.</p>
				<p>In <span class="movietitle">Night Skies</span>, one of the aliens, a benevolent one named Buddy, befriends an autistic boy. This side-plot provided the axis for Spielberg’s movie about kids, <span class="movietitle">E.T.,</span> while <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> remained the “hostile” successor to <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>.</p>

I, on the other hand, didn't have rack of lamb between both pictures, I essentially had Motza and butter, and that was about it and went right into the next movie. But, um, both movies were very good for me to make. So in such close proximity to  each other, because both being rooted in suburbia in a kind of middle-class suburbia, both essentially employing similar kinds of tract housing. And yet one screen movie being about a scream and the other movie being about a kind of soft whisper.  It was very good for me because I was able to trade off objectivity, which I think is very important for a movie director or a writer is anybody who has to stand away from his work and look back and say, I know how to make that better. It's good to have diversions. And I was very lucky because I was able to have a hostile diversion with Poltergeist, with spiritual warmth in places. And I was able to have that. Warm tender diversion with ITI. And I kept putting one into the other, not meaning I didn't share it too with Poltergeist, but I, I, it cleared my mind when you eat sushi. I dunno. You know, when you would sushi the Japanese say, you must take the ginger and eat a little bit of the ginger between sushi courses, because it clears the palate and it makes you more receptive to the taste of the food.”</figcaption>

				<p><strong>Kael’s Critique, Jaws, USS Indianapolis “the hidden confusion of historical fact and sadistic fantasy.”</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Jaws (1975)</strong><br><strong>Susan Backlinie</strong><br><strong>Jeffrey Voorhees</strong><br><strong>Carl Rizzo</strong><br><strong>+Brown (E.T.)</strong></p>
				<p>Spielberg first saw the galleys for Peter Benchley’s novel, <em>Jaws</em>, on his Universal Studios producer Dick Zanuck’s desk in 1973. He begged to make it, and it was only after Universal won the rights that Spielberg realized how difficult it would be to shoot. Because of its technical challenges, <em>Jaws</em> went several times over its originally planned shooting schedule and budget at Martha’s Vineyard. Although Benchley wrote the first draft, it was quickly discarded. A second draft by Howard Sackler was more successful at reducing the story to its elements. The final pages were written by Carl Gottlieb with Spielberg every night after dinner at Spielberg’s cabin, with the extended schedule affording them time to workshop scenes with the leads (McBride 238-9).</p>

				<p>Spielberg once told <a href="https://youtu.be/3SUmUnLMWYQ?si=V0QxZyJDzxCKMrRL&t=482">Pauline Kael</a> that she was the only film critic to understand <span class="movietitle">Jaws.</span> <a href="https://emdashes.com/2006/08/a-goldmine-of-pauline-kael-rev.php">Picking up on</a> the bits he had riffed with his actors, she interpreted the movie as a lampoon of toxic masculinity; like an early Woody Allen film, but with more zest and electricity. She saw Spielberg’s verve as a filmmaker reflected in Dreyfuss’ playful post-doc, and, to a lesser extent, in the sensitive Chief Brody, as opposed to Shaw’s old-school alpha male, “so manly he wants to get them all killed; so manly he’s homicidal.” She was still able to read <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> as a sort of New Hollywood art film because of its unusual rhythms. It was campy and sweet at the same time as it was violent and jarring.</p>
				<p>As much as Pauline Kael liked <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, there was something about it that nagged at her. It was what she called “the hidden confusion of historical fact and sadistic fantasy.” It concerns Quint’s famous USS Indianapolis monologue.</p>
				<p>“He tells the ultimate shark horror story—it's worse, even, than anything that we see in the movie. The story he tells concerns the men of the Indianapolis, a heavy cruiser that was torpedoed after delivering key elements of the atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan. As Shaw, in drunken, sepulchral tones, describes the events, the survivors were attacked by sharks, which returned day after day, using the ever-smaller group of survivors as a feeding ground. Actually, it is not known how many of the Indianapolis crew died because of sharks, or how many died from exposure, or from injuries sustained when the ship was hit. The monologue, conceived by Howard Sackler, embellished to a length of nine pages by John Milius, and then trimmed by Spielberg and Shaw to a feasible length, could easily have dealt with a fictitious ship, but using the correct name gave it an extra plausibility. In the rest of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, we're worked over right in the open, but in this Indianapolis episode we're fooled by a hidden confusion of historical fact and sadistic fantasy. The writers probably didn't consider—or were simply indifferent to the nightmarish pain that their gothic embroidery would give to the relatives of the men who died in those waters.”</p>
				<p>Kael found it distasteful that the audience would be led to perceive a true story as though it were fiction, specifically because the secret fictionalization of the truth was <em>sadistic</em>: that is, causing pain needlessly. The analysis could be extended further, as the stunts of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> were known to be sloppy. Susan Backlinie, who played the first shark victim, was pulled back and forth by 10 men on each side with ropes, and, according to Julia Phillips, suffered lacerations and bruises for years to come (“don’t ask”). When Jeffrey Voorhees, the child who played the Kintner boy killed before Brody’s eyes, was supposed to go down in an explosion of blood, he couldn’t get the timing right, so a diver was sent to hold him under water.</p>
				<p>And—most to Kael’s point—when the production needed footage of Dreyfuss encountering the gigantic Jaws underwater, they decided to hire a person of short stature to get the scale right against real Great Whites filmed in Australian waters. This person was lowered into chummed waters with a defective oxygen tank, and nearly eaten alive. He appears never to have worked in the industry again.</p>
				<p>Just a year before the accident, during a long-form <a href="https://youtu.be/ZCmPtl39BWQ?t=2168">interview</a> on the <span class="movietitle">Dick Cavett Show</span> in 1981, Spielberg demonstrated a strong acquaintance with the possibility for stunt accidents in the industry:</p>
				
	     	<div class="transcript">
						<p>Cavett: Do you know situations—obviously without naming names and so on—where the stuntmen have been unnecessarily endangered, and in fact, maimed and killed? I know one lost both legs. Is it Yvonne de Carlos’ husband...—</p>
						<p>Spielberg: Do you mean the helicopter accident?</p>
						<p>Cavett: This is two trains.</p>
						<p>Speilberg: There’s a famous helicopter accident where... it wasn't a stuntman. He was a cameraman with a special Tyler mount out the back of a jet ranger, the side of a jet ranger. He went too close to another helicopter below him and he lost his legs. ...</p>
						<p>I mean, it’s not just stuntmen. The tragedy last week where we lost Boris Sagal. Very, very excellent and wonderful director and human being who walked into the back rotor blade of a propeller. ...</p>
						<p>There's something that happens when you're making a film, especially with directors and cameras. And that is when your eye is to the camera, you are taken away to a Never-Never land, a kind of reality Oz. And suddenly, with the eye glued to the camera, nothing can happen to you. You could be on the edge of a train, looking through a viewfinder, heading towards a tunnel with no clearance. And as far as you're concerned, it's only a movie until everything goes black, and then white. And I think, I think it's, it's, it's almost the sirens that are calling you.</p>

					<a id="section-01n"></a><h3>#01n. Musing on the problem for years</h3>
					
					<p>In negotiating a deal with Warner Bros., Spielberg and Landis initially proposed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=7wz8-W7GHfE-_3Kj&t=590&v=pIZk6jN3g0s&feature=youtu.be">“negative pickup” agreement</a>, meaning the filmmakers simply had to deliver the edited film negative in order to fulfill their contractual obligation and be paid. Then, to finance the movie, the filmmaker(s) takes out a bank loan.</p>
					<p>The studio rejected this initial offer, requesting some basic oversight. This was a high priority given Landis’s reputation for excess, and Spielberg’s incredible success over the past year (<span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>, <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>) with a heavily regulated production schedule.</p>
					<p>The parties agreed that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>John Landis, through Levitsky Productions, Inc., would receive</li>
						<li>$150,000 for his work on <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: The Movie</span> ($30,000 for writing; $30,000 for producing; $90,000 for directing).</li>
						<li>Co-producer split: 50-50 between Landis and Spielberg.</li>
						<li>They each received five gross points (5%) of the movie's earnings, escalating to 12.5% of gross receipts beyond $15 million, and 15% beyond the initial break-even. Even though <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: The Movie</span> had modest box office earnings with $34 million domestic, these gross points would amount to approximately $3.5 million for each of them, not counting international box office, rental, or licensing fees.</li>
						<li>Landis had the final cut on his segment, provided the film was completed on schedule and budget (no more than 10% over) and rated PG.  </li>
						<li>“John acknowledges that Steven may have a presentation credit. The credits to John on screen and in paid advertising shall be not less equal in size and treatment than all other similar producer, writer and director credits other than the presentation credit to Steven.”</li>
						<li>Frank Marshall: $100,000 flat fee, 0.5% of gross after break-even, and 3% of net profit. Richard Matheson and George Miller: Small percentage of net profit apart from fees. (Chain 54-56)</li>
					</ul>

					<a id="section-02n"></a><h3>#02n. A Steven Spielberg Production?</h3>
					
					<p>Although several initial news reports stated that the tragedy occurred on “a Steven Spielberg production” (or similar), within days, Spielberg’s name was removed from the story. When the movie was finally released, it had no “Presentation credit.”</p>
					<p><span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: The Movie</span> (1983) was most likely originally going to be “a Steven Spielberg Production.” This is only significant as part of the broader argument that Spielberg had every likelihood of being invested in the film’s production.</p>
					<p>The deal memo stipulates that “Steven may have a presentation credit,” and the initial highly-researched NTSB report stated that “The film, “Twilight Zone” is a STEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCTION funded by Warner Bros. Inc., Burbank California” (2); the revised edition (following several petitions from the defense) does not include this specification; perhaps because Spielberg never claimed the credit.</p>
					<p>By July 1982, Amblin was still in its fledgling stages, sorting out its branding and product lines for the rest of the decade.</p>
					<p>Spielberg’s first production entity was Amblin’ Productions, Inc. (est. 1970), named after the short film he'd just produced at the time. Spielberg would continue to use this as his personal loan-out company through 1980. During this time he produced the Gale and Zemeckis movie, <span class="movietitle">I Wanna Hold Your Hand</span> (1978), as “Steven Spielberg Presents.” (He also produced Zemeckis’ <em>Used Cars</em> (1980) but without a presentation credit). </p>
					<p>After the founding of Amblin Entertainment, Inc. in 1980, Spielberg produced <span class="movietitle">Continental Divide</span> (1981) as “an AMBLIN Production,” but this was a one-off, with “Amblin Entertainment Presents” occurring only once or twice through to the 90s.</p>
					<p><em>Poltergeist</em> (1982) is “A Steven Spielberg Production.” <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> (1982) is “A Steven Spielberg Film,” and <span class="movietitle">Goonies</span> (1984) is a “Steven Spielberg Presents.” </p>
					<p>By the mid-eighties, Amblin had established a two-tier product line: “Steven Spielberg Presents,” (for works not directed by Spielberg) and “A Steven Spielberg Film” (for works directed by Spielberg).</p>
					<p>As well, it’s possible <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> was initially conceived by Spielberg as a potential franchise.</p>
					
					<div class="blockquote largequote">
						<p>Ted Ashley, who was Serling's agent at the time that the writer created <span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span>, had graduated to the position of chairman of the board at Warner Bros. Following the success of <span class="movietitle">Star Wars</span>, <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span>, and <span class="movietitle">Alien</span> in the late seventies, Ashley decided the time was right to create a big-screen fantasy built around the concept of <span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span>. <span class="movietitle">Star Trek</span>, another TV show that had a fanatical cult following, was being turned into a whole series of feature films. Ashley imagined the same future for <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>. (F&G 64)</p>

					<p>“Before the accident, everyone was talking about sequels, and that idea was forgotten.” (Carol Serling, qtd. in F&G, 172)</p>
		
					<a id="section-03n"></a><h3>#03n. “8:00 or 8:30pm”</h3>
		
					<p>In Landis’s testimony (Feb. 1987), he reported that on or around Friday, July 9th, 1982, a second meeting took place at his offices on the Universal Studios lot. Present were Marshall, Landis himself, Folsey, and Allingham. He stated that the first meeting—approximately Tuesday, July 6th—had centered on Marshall’s question about whether it would be possible to obtain waivers for young children to work past 6:30 p.m., which Marshall acknowledged was the legal cut-off. The defendants say Marshall told them he would have his colleague, Kathleen Kennedy, call the Labor Board to inquire.</p>
					<p>At the second meeting, the defendants say Marshall informed them that waivers could only be obtained until “8:00 or 8:30 p.m” (James Neal’s opening statement; Landis’s testimony).</p>
					<p>However, Colleen Logan, Area Administrator for the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, testified that the Department’s policy was to grant extensions until exactly 10:00 p.m., when requested (trial testimony; cf. closing arguments).</p>
					<p>If the defendants’ account of the “8:00 or 8:30 p.m.” restriction is accurate, then where did Marshall get that timeframe? Did he actually have Kennedy—or anyone—call the Labor Board?</p>
					<p>If not, why not?</p>
					<p>Is it possible that Marshall, given his experience as a producer, already knew waivers were unlikely to be granted—not because of the late hour, but due to the children's proximity to dangerous practical effects? If so, any call to the Labor Board would have drawn unwanted attention to the production and been clearly ill-advised. But then, why would Marshall present the issue to the defendants as one of scheduling rather than safety?</p>
					<p>The point is that if the defendants were genuinely naïve or deferential to Marshall’s expertise, he may have misrepresented the obstacle as a matter of timing rather than danger—thus downplaying the seriousness of the subsequent illegal hiring.</p>
					<p>To what end—and at whose direction?</p>
		
					<a id="section-04n"></a><h3>#04n. A semantic misunderstanding?</h3>
					
					<p>Chain claims the existence of a series of interdepartmental Warner Bros memos detailing interviews with key figures involved in the production on the Warner Bros side in the days after the accident, including Lucy Fisher and Frank Marshall.</p>

<p>If the authenticity of these memos is accepted, it means that Lucy Fisher told Warner Bros. lawyers that she had specifically asked both Landis and Marshall whether the children newly added to the script would be “a problem,” and both men assured her that not it would not. She let them know if asked, she would deny any knowledge of the matter. (Chain Ch. 18; Ch. 47)</p>

<p>Marshall, for his part, allegedly told Warner Bros. lawyers that he had no idea what Folsey Jr.’s “Personal Cash advance” cheque was for, having assumed it was going to be used for its stated purposes. In his recounting of an early July meeting at Landis’s Universal Studios compound (he remembered just one, not two), he had told Landis’s people that it would not be possible to use young children later than 8:30. Instead, he suggested, they should pursue waivers to hire 13-year-olds that look young, which he assumed they did for the shots in which Marshall saw the children prior to the 2:20am shot.</p>

<p>Marshall said that for that shot in particular, he was under the impression that dummies were going to be used. This was because at that same meeting, when he told Allingham to “forget about” the possibility of using children legally, Allingham said it wouldn’t be a problem because it would be a "long shot." What Marshall could have understood by that was "we will be far away so we can use dummies without the spectator being aware,” but what Allingham meant was, “we can put Morrow and the kids further away from the explosions than it will appear on the screen so it will be safer than it looks on film.”</p>

<p>The devil is in the details, however, and the question remains why Marshall, with his experience, thought it was appropriate even for 13-year-olds to be in the conditions he witnessed Myca and Renee to be in?</p>

<p>And why didn't he double check, given such flimsy assurances by untrustworthy agents, of a nefarious act reported by a reliable 3rd party over a month in advance of Landis doing exactly that?</p>

<a id="section-07n"></a><h3>#07n. “Fly by Night”</h3>

<img src="../full/pics/n2.jpg">

<p>Allingham presented himself to prospective helicopter pilot Clay Wright as working for “Fly By Night” (Chain Ch. 4). According to Chain, “Fly by Night Productions” was the name that Landis had given his segment’s production company for Twilight Zone, in original contract negotiations with Warner, before the deal became structured so that no production entity specific to Landis was needed. According to LaBrecque, at least, it was a “joking tribute to Steven Spielberg, who had called his own production company by that nickname” (26). Chain points out, as well, its utility in telegraphing a thrifty indie film rather than a studio-backed major. “Fly by Night” was painted on the nose of the helicopter; its existence is noted by Budds in his Oct. 26 supplementary police report: “The helicopter was olive-drab in color with a painted decal on the nose which read, "Fly by night.”” The decal was erased by an unknown critic in the later morning hours of July 23rd, 1982. (See Chain, Exhibits.)</p>

<a id="section-08n"></a><h3>#08n. Steve Williams</h3>

<p>Steve Williams resists the emphasis on Tippett’s “extinction” narrative. Williams had been Animation Supervisor on The Abyss and Terminator 2, and now, despite single-handedly redeeming the prospect of seamless CGI for Jurassic Park, that role was given to Tippett. “Kathleen Kennedy pats me on the back and goes, ‘You have a very bright future.’ And that was that. That was the first and only time I ever met her. I never saw her again.” He was astonished by the lack of recognition that followed his breakthrough, failing to be acknowledged even in Jurassic Park’s Best Visual Effects Oscar speech.</p>

<a id="section-09n"></a><h3>#09n. Steve Starkey</h3>

	<p>Steven <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Breaking_and_Entering.html?id=JZc6zwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y">Starkey</a> had been an editor at ILM assigned to edit a promotional documentary for Frank Marshall: <span class="movietitle">The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>. He would go on to edit <span class="movietitle">The Making of Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">The Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>, before moving into the Amblin bungalow on the Universal lot and was encouraged to pivot to Associate Producer by Frank Marshall, who was solidified as his “mentor.” Starkey was hired on to <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> in September 1990, when he was put in charge of preparing a budget and a production plan in coordination with Carter. They had previously worked together on <span class="movietitle">Amazing Stories</span> and <span class="movietitle">Back to the Future Part II</span> and <span class="movietitle">III</span>. Their first budget was too expensive for Spielberg, so they began to make script revisions. Eventually, Steve Starkey turned these into a 3-page document that allowed Spielberg to greenlight the budget. But once <span class="movietitle">Hook</span> started, Starkey was put onto other projects (he’d initially felt “jilted” when his contribution had been minimized, but was quickly offered the role of Producer on <span class="movietitle">Death Becomes Her</span>). Carter and Starkey’s work would eventually become <a href="https://www.trescom.org/hosted/scallenger/jurassictime/jtfiles/research/scripts/JURASSIC%20PARK%2003-07-1991%20\(Carter%20&%20Crichton\">Carter’s draft</a>%20%5bTranscription%5d.pdf), following a separate evolution from Crichton’s first draft; but then incorporating the changes Spielberg liked from Crichton’s second along with ideas brainstormed a few days later. Carter knew Crichton personally and had been in touch with him to keep apprised of story developments. He’d also submitted several <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3024487960943222&type=3">story memos</a> of his own. Although Tom Stoppard (<span class="movietitle">Empire of the Sun</span>, 1989) was being considered, Carter knew Marmo was also in the conversation but was <a href="https://youtu.be/3TOJwJKPg4o?si=bGVGrfds_zL2BzEs&t=270">concerned</a> that she was going to (or did, eventually) take the story down “the wrong path.” The existence of Carter’s draft was only uncovered in 2020 by Derrick Davis. He turned it into an <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/rcjp-illustrated-audio-drama">illustrated audio drama</a>, imagining Carter’s version brought to life, in which he combined the script and story memos with his collection of rare and unreleased concept art and storyboards, including an entire binder that had belonged to Tippett.</em></p>

							<p>“I remember being totally scared of him,” says Janice Zusman, who lived in the house behind the Spielbergs. “One time Susie and I were playing Barbie dolls by the canal near our house, on Indian School Road. I would have been grounded for life if my parents knew I’d even gone near the canal. We were pretending it was the Grand Canyon. Steve was bugging us and teasing us: ‘If you don’t do whatever’—unfortunately, I don’t remember what it was he wanted us to do—‘then I’m going to throw your Barbie into the canal.’ He grabbed my Barbie doll and yanked the head off and threw it into the canal. The most important thing in my life was this Barbie doll! It was so traumatic I’ve been talking about it ever since. The worst thing was that I couldn’t tell my folks, so I had to go down and fish the head out of the canal.” (McBride 89ff.)</p></div>

					<p>Did the Barbie doll symbol hold any personal significance to the filmmaker, any at all, or was it just another shared relic of a bygone era?</p>
