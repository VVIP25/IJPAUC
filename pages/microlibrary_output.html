<p><a href="../full/mp4s/d11.mp4">“I had started using cocaine and amphetamines way before the success. And in fact had had quite a bit of success working behind them. [...] There was a definite progression that went from using it as a tool, to using it as a crutch, and then you weren’t using it for anything except that it was life itself.”</a></p>

<p>I am a spotter of trends: the drug paranoia underlying the movie [<span class="movietitle">Easy Rider</span>] is rampant in the alternative culture that has sprouted. It amazes me that this is not obvious to the people releasing the picture. (90)</p> </div>

    <div class="blockquote largequote"><p>And so, with little money in our pockets, we start to organize weekend-long soirees. People have such a good time, and are so impressed with who they meet, they bring more interesting people the next week. These enterprises grow and grow and it is possible to see Robert Redford and Liza Minnelli, the veteran famous, along with Brian De Palma, Marty Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg, unheralded and barely known, drinking wine, eating steak, walking on the beach. A rare mixture of haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>Plus there is a fascinating beach community: the Dunnes, the Moores, Katherine Ross and Conrad Hall, Lee Grant and Joey Feury... And always, always, talk—grandiose talk—about movies, about the state of movies and how much better they will be when we make them.</p>
<p>Pot is around, some psychedelics, and there is a whole branch that is getting into Arica. (104)</p></div>

<p>SCENE FROM A MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE:</p>
<p>ovo: I am standing on a chair, having a face-to-face over a glass of wine with Michael Crichton one afternoon at Margot and Jennifer’s, early seventies. He and Paul Lazarus are making a movie called <span class="movietitle">Westworld</span> over at MGM with Dan Melnick.</p>

<p>Michael Phillips and Michael Crichton know each other from Roslyn. They used to do the circle jerk as Cub Scouts together. Male bonding. It is amazing how many people from Great Neck and Roslyn there are trying to make their way in show biz. A number of them do... (123)</p></div>

    <summary>In this case: theaters, how wide the release, how much money for a network buy...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>In this case: theaters, how wide the release, how much money for a network buy. <span class="movietitle">The Sting</span> is coming out right in the middle of a marketing revolution. Up until <span class="movietitle">The Godfather</span>, every time you had a picture you thought was going to have reviews and audience appeal, you let it out slowly in a handful of chichi theaters in the major cities, and let it build. Then you went in ever widening waves. But Frank Yablans had released <span class="movietitle">The Godfather</span>, and then <span class="movietitle">Love Story</span>, as if they were two-week actioners, and now everyone was figuring out that a quality picture could really rake in the dough. Fast and long. Not one or the other.</p>
<p>The revolution has not yet occurred at Universal, which at this point in its career has not decided if it is in the movie business or not. It is definitely in the TV business, but not too many people there are in the movie business. There are George Roy Hill and Steven Spielberg, and Sid Sheinberg and Ned Tanen. Outside of them, nobody at Universal knows that there is a marketing revolution going on.</p>
<p>By the time they release <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> for Steven, they will know it and go with a thousand theaters. But just now, they are going with about thirty-five in key markets, and I am checking out with Lederer and Leo, who together form a pretty dynamic marketing duo for Warners, if I should take a stand or not. I have made myself learn a lot about this part of picture-making on <span class="movietitle">Steelyard Blues</span>, and I figure I should apply it to <span class="movietitle">The Sting</span>.

    <summary>I don’t know what he means by it,” I lie, “but Steven says he wants to do a movie about UFOs and Watergate, and I want to do it with him...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>I don’t know what he means by it,” I lie, “but Steven says he wants to do a movie about UFOs and Watergate, and I want to do it with him.” I am leaning on the edge of Begelman’s desk, because when you are in his office, it is best to stand. He likes to keep the heat up and the Muzak just at the edge of your consciousness. He likes the vibe soporific. He likes to keep the meetings short and docile.</p>
<p>I like to walk around anyway. It helps me to keep my naturally circuitous thinking patterns linear. I make more points walking, and I slamdunk on the sudden stop or the lean against the desk. Begelman stands up; now he is taller than me again.</p>
<p>“I’m in,” he says. “Let’s go.” Lies work. Just sweep him along on pure excitement.</p>
<p>How am I to explain to D.B. that anyone who has ever dropped acid and looked up at the sky for a while or smoked a joint and watched the Watergate hearings on TV is waiting for this movie? And that it is uniquely this group of people who is going to give it to them? Hubris and youth and the promise of really good drugs fire these ambitions. There is no question in my mind that this group—weak as we are on story and screenplay—can pull it off. It will be like building a city. (139)</p></div>

<p>...Steven and Michael and me wait in the holding area outside Begelman’s office. We wait for Begelman, but more to the point, we wait for Guy McElwaine, a star agent at ICM. He represents Steven, so he is going to represent all of us on <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>. We offered to do that to guarantee Steven staying in the project. Steven was hanging out with men who were too old for him. Who bet and drank and watched football games on Sunday. Who ran studios and agencies. [...]</p>
<p>We got Steven outta Guy’s house in the Bev Hills flats, and on to the beach, where people were still discussing art and greatness, and were occasionally smoking a joint. Where the ambient sound was rock ’n’ roll, and the house wasn’t so decorated that even the inhabitants felt like guests. Steven was the most talented contemporary we knew. He and Michael had become friendly while we were at Universal and we’d seen some dailies of <em>Sugarland Express</em>. We wanted to guarantee his staying in, and Guy and ICM hitting us seemed reasonable. (140)</p></div>

    <summary>I have Columbia spending constantly...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>I have Columbia spending constantly. On tests, on more assistants, on one under-the-table rewrite after another. The Beges has agreed not to read Schrader’s first draft, called <span class="booktitle">Kingdom Come</span>, because I told him it would make him not want to make the movie. Certainly it was not a screenplay that Steven wanted to direct, although it very much created the Roy Neary character, a man obsessed by something way beyond his intellectual but within his visceral comprehension.

    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>Michael has made it clear he ain’t doin’ it; he’s planning to go around the world in search of the soul he doesn’t have. Originally Verna Fields, who edited <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, was going to be associate producer, but then Steven started to resent all the credit she was giving herself for its success and asked me to kill her off.</p>
<p>Which, to be honest, was fine with me, because I hadn’t liked her from the start. She was my mother: angry, bitter, middle-aged, frustrated. Mad at all the kids having their big shots. Being the Big Shots. Once she and I were invited to speak to a convention of Eastman Kodak types in Rochester, New York. I had just done one of those silly commercials for them that appeared in all the <span class="booktitle">Film Digest</span> magazines. I had mentioned her in the body of the copy and Steven had cut her out and said, Come up with another woman. I had put Marcia Lucas’s name instead. (188)</p></div>

<p>“All great movies are the product of one person’s <em>obsession,</em>” he keeps telling me. My <em>obsession,</em> his film. Not a very good deal. But I’m not into deals. I am into one step in front of the other, up the ladder, don’t get stuck, stuck here on the ladder of my life... (189)</p></div>

<p>Basically, though, I am here with David Begelman’s money babysitting Steven while <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> opens in New York. I have worked long and hard keeping Steven’s interest in the project. Today he has gone around the City in a cab with Albert Brooks taking home movies of the lines of people waiting to get in to the theaters. The boyish joy and pleasure he expresses make me, a natural cynic, feel more hopeful. He is so blatant in his excitement for himself that he is adorable. I do not notice for at least a year that this kind of behavior bespeaks a childish self-preoccupation that tends to remove all hope. In the end. Because cynics are hopeless romantics, and they get more disappointed. (196)</p></div>

    <summary>Grady doesn’t think twenty-five grand is enough money to sit in Francis’s suite with Steven and learn how to write movies...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>Grady doesn’t think twenty-five grand is enough money to sit in Francis’s suite with Steven and learn how to write movies. He complains about the money constantly. I keep him provided with blow, to take his mind off the money, and he complains about that too. He has actually managed to make me feel like a failure getting him only twenty-five. He should know what it was like getting twenty-five for him from Stanley Jaffe.

				<p>When I first asked Stanley for the money he dismissed the request and told me that friends did rewrites for free. I tried to explain that Grady was a friend, but he was also from television, and was routinely paid fifteen hundred bucks just to watch someone else’s run-through and write a couple of jokes. I tried working it out with Stanley, teasing cajoling flirting but he was resistant. I kept telling him that this was who Steven wanted and we had already gone through a number of writers for free. We had gone through some writers for money, too. The best ideas were freebies from other film-maker types we were hanging out with. Brian De Palma came up with the implantation of the mountain. I never really knew whose idea was what, not even my own anymore. Steven would call at night sometimes, and chat about ideas. With <span class="movietitle">Tubular Bells</span> playing in the background. I never knew if they were his ideas, or Barwood and Robbins’. (226)</p></p></div>

<p>(On Francois Truffaut, whom they’d cast as one of the leads in <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>:)</p>
<p>“Steven, I’m telling you that left-ear shit is as authentic as the gimp.” A couple of sentences per day were devoted to this subject.</p>
<p>“He’s deaf,” Steven argued. “He makes me repeat everything several times, even with Sally translating.” It didn’t occur to Steven that he was being pimped. People as manipulative as Steven never think that they could be just players in other people’s mind games.</p>
<p>“Making you repeat stuff could be any number of things,” I pushed. “He could be trying to understand his part, which is the nice interpretation. Or he could be pulling a power play. Making you repeat yourself too many times for you to be the boss.” Silence. It was either too easy or too hard to get Steven Spielberg’s attention. That’s why he was such a great director: for him it had to be perfect small moments between people or Barnum &amp; Bailey. Lots of directors were doing small moments but no one was doing the circus quite so well. </p>
<p>Halfway through dinner I whispered “François” and he turned minutely in my direction. Of course, Steven argued that it was an inconclusive gesture, and he welched on the bet. I know I won because it earned me François’s eternal enmity.</p>
<p>When the dinner was over and we had all said our goodnights, we got back into Steven’s car. We sat in silence for a moment while the car warmed up. We turned to each other. For no particular reason, I put my arms around his neck and stuck my tongue in his mouth. We had a good long kiss. He pulled away. His glasses were tilted at a ridiculous angle; he looked frightened.</p>
<p>“Jul-ee-a, that was a real kiss...” Treasure it, pal, it’s the one and only. More silence during the drive to Burbank and I patted his hand in a comforting gesture before I got out of his car and into mine.</p>
<p>I drove home very fast and brushed my teeth twice before I went to bed. The things a girl will do just to make a great movie...(244-5)</p></div>

<p>The test had been sitting in the projection booth all day, but I was so busy I was forty-five minutes late on everything and long overdue for a bathroom visit. If I didn’t see it right away, though,  Steven would think I didn’t care. And if I didn’t care enough he might commit to another picture. I had once written in lipstick on his bathroom mirror, “Stop me before I make another deal,” and he’d laughed but he continued to read scripts. It created underlying pressure at all times and it gave me a big headache every night at about six thirty. (245)</p>

<p>Steven calls out to me to get on the cherry picker so I can see the shot. With the exception of Melinda stumbling every time on her walk up the hill, it looks very wonderful through the camera.

<p>Steven has bought a scooter and gone off driving on it during lunch hour. He has a Jewish nerd’s touch with wheels. He is a lousy walker, and I start going along for the ride, although what I think I usually accomplish more than they get to say people killed instead of one, I don’t understand. I can scream <em>Slow down</em> in his ear, and hope he will listen. I do, after all, as they like to say, have his ear. It is actually remarkable, considering, how far I seem to be going by being in someone’s ear. Redford. Streisand. Steven. No power of my own, just the power to have someone’s ear. (253)</p></div>

<p>The Neary house is a temper tester. No air conditioning, blacks encasing the house so we can shoot day for night. We seem to be getting hung up on the mashed potatoes and the mountain. Every time the mountain gets bigger, Dreyfuss taps on it and yells, “Victoria, Victoria Principal, are you in there?” Steven ran with her for awhile, somewhere between Sara Miles and the Bimbo. Steven’s taste in women is on a par with my taste in men. As in, not so hot. (256)</p> </div>

<p>I light a joint and ease my way onto Mulholland Drive. A beautiful twilight is amplified by the sun caught in various levels of smog that hang over the Valley. I am so absorbed in this sight that I almost wrong-turn down Coldwater Canyon and have to veer left sharply to continue on Mulholland. Red and blue lights fire up in my rearview mirror... [...]</p>
<p>Involuntarily I grab my cigarette case and clutch it in my hand as he asks for my license and registration. Then the smell of the pot hits him, and he asks me to step out of the car. Now the other cop ambles over. He is dark and has a mustache and looks like he probably smokes marijuana on the weekends.</p>
<p>The cossack asks for my cigarette case and I give it to him. No doubt he is searching for a joint, but the whole fucking pack falls into his hands and Michael’s silver coke bottle falls onto the ground.</p>
<p>“We’ve got coke here!” he exclaims excitedly to his partner, who seems reluctant to go on. Even I know this is going to turn out to be a bad bust—a roach and the remnants of the surfer coke [...]</p>
<p>The day after, I vomit all day. In between trips to the bathroom I call Andrea, Norman, and Steven. Andrea clucks sympathy and disapproval. Norman and Steven fly over. [...]</p>
<p>Steven and I hang out for a little while watching television. “I hope Rona Barrett doesn’t get hold of this,” he says. “You know, she’s been asking a lot of questions about you and the drugs. You gotta stop for a while...”</p>
<p>“No shit. Listen, thanks for coming over. But now it’s time to go. I’m gonna be sick.” He seems relieved to be dismissed. After he leaves I fall asleep. I sleep through Sunday and wake up Monday morning to Rona Barrett reporting news of my arrest. [...]</p>
<p>It crosses my mind that Steven, not a stringer at the station, has passed the information, but I dismiss it. We are far too tight for him to do that to me.</p>

<p>Steven insists we resist the urge to sleep. He says it is the only way we will turn around Over There. Since he is far more traveled, having gone around the world with each new opening of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> the previous summer and fall, I decide to go his way. Besides, he needs a playmate, and that is me. Has been for a couple of years, now. His wish is pretty much my command. So we dump our bags at the Dorchester and hop back in our car. The driver takes us to Windsor Castle, and then, because it is so cold, to the actual mile-square old city of London.</p>
<p>“They put the heads of their enemies on stakes outside the city as an example,” he says, as we step out of the car near the gate. I stop at a headstone. It says: <em>Here lies Sir Rupert, most fearfully betrayed and murdered on this spot by his fellows, 1585.</em> I read it twice. I look at Steven.</p>
<p>“Most fearfully <em>betrayed</em>...” I say, and he smiles. The winds are really whipping around us now, so we get back in the car. “Is it teatime yet?” I ask. I want to taste a scone and rid myself of an embryonic FFA, with its aura of a migraine coming on.(315-16)</p></div>

    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>I am looking at the credits on the back of the album jacket while I am chatting with Steven one day. We are in postproduction on <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> and people are starting to figure out that it might really be something. Steven has insisted on total secrecy from the start: closed set, closed dailies, locked doors whenever possible. We are still cloaked in secrecy, but it is hard to have that many people in your employ trying to do that many things that have never been done before without being visible.</p>
<p>Plus, he and I have made it a point to show up for certain things: David Begelman’s wedding to Gladyce, held at Ray Stark’s pad, out on the lawn among the Moore sculptures; the Oscars, the Golden Globes, etc., not to mention our posts at Ma Maison, La Scala, and the Imperial Gardens. You run into pretty much everybody in town that way.</p>
<p>The problem with showing up at these events with Steven is Amy. She didn’t like us going to the Oscars and the Golden Globes together on all those <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span> nominations. I would’ve been happy to take someone else, but Steven and I are tight as can be, and it makes good business sense to show up together. [...]</p>
<p>When Dick Sylbert expressed a desire to meet Steven, I arranged a dinner as a foursome. Maybe Amy wouldn’t get pissed off that way, I figured. We dine at Dominick’s and I’m the last one there. Steven’s mouth twitches with annoyance. At some point the guys get it on, and Amy and I repair to the bathroom. I pee; she fucks with her hair. She pees; I fuck with my hair. Wash hands. Good little girls. Share a secret—well, maybe two. Bad little girls. And I think, Well, now we share secrets, we’re pals. Fat chance. Every time Amy is afraid she’s losing Steven, she opts for a tearful confession. Bad enough to blow your cover, bitch, tacky to blow mine... I think she’s retaliating for the Oscars and the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>Steven starts to complain about her... he’s nervous that he’s let her move into the house, the house I told him to buy...</p>
<p>“Maybe you should talk to her, Ju-lee-a,” he stutters. Steven stutters a lot. He also repeats whatever you just said to him back to you. It reminds me of my father, when he had his clinical depression. In the beginning of our mission to make <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, these personality traits seemed endearing, now they bore me. And I know he is at the end of his rope on my drugs and lateness. Still we’re tight enough for him to imply that it would be a nice procedural gesture on my part to move her out of his house. I laugh in his face. In your earhole, man.</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting...” He interrupts me with laughter. Best defense with me.</p>
<p>“Forget it..." (332-333)</p>

    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>I have gotten Steven a great deal of money to shoot the ET. Columbia, and all the bankers and the Herbie Allens, and Alan Hirschfields and Joe Fischers and David Begelmans, etc., have gone down the whole road with us. Not always happily, sometimes reluctantly, but they have stuck with us. And they haven’t seen dick. And they aren’t going to for quite some time, because we need the extraterrestrial to find focus for the “experience,” as Verna Fields once dubbed it. For the last twenty, maybe even thirty, minutes of the movie.</p>
<p>Every time I walk on the set, Michael is working one of the controls for the ET. He is desperately searching for a role to play on the picture, now that he’s back from his soulsearch and has an inkling of what <em>Close Encounters</em> is. I think he looks ridiculous and I am unbeatable. I am wrong.</p>
<p>At the end of two weeks, I have to force Steven to wrap the ET, or we’ll never get the amount of time he wants on the dubbing stage. We have a fight instead of a party. Clark Paylow calls me later to tell me that he and Michael have told Steven he can keep shooting and Steven has said, “Julia says I can’t shoot anymore. Without Julia there would be no <em>Close Encounters</em>...” I guess Clark is telling me this story to make me feel better. I am at the point where nothing makes me feel better.</p>
<p>Michael and I have gone to a screening and gotten into a fight before the film starts to roll. As the lights go down he says, under his breath so Mike Kahn won’t hear, “I hate you.” Tears shoot out of my eyes and I split. I go into a three-sixty spin at the corner of Schuyler and scare myself half to death. Steven calls, enraged, about my leaving the screening and I tell him the story. They run the picture for me the next day but I know I am not forgiven... (335)</p>

    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>I’ve been waiting to see that shot all my life,” Steven says, pleased. “And I got it for you. We have a great deal of the footage for the end of the movie, and we have reached the point where it is smarter to put it together and then see what effects we need, than to create the effects and then cut them together. I don’t want to waste any of the money that is getting harder and harder to squeeze out of Columbia.</p>
<p>One day Steven calls from the editing room at the Marina and tells me to drop everything and get over there. The only other time he has ever done that was with the discovery of Cary Guffy, so I drop everything.</p>
<p>... The entire third act of the movie—the experience—flows before me. All that disparate footage, pulled together. Even without a good percentage of the effects it is coherent, beautiful, uplifting... they’ve nailed it! Hugs and kisses all around. I depart elated. I think I am one of maybe three people who knows how huge this picture is...” [...]</p>
<p>“I want to talk about the opening credits,” Steven says. He has already made me pressure every writer who made a contribution to the script. When the Writers’ Guild insists on an arbitration, I get Schrader and Grady to back off their right to credits. When his lawyer, Bruce Ramer, a nice guy who wants to stay that way, also backs off from the issue, Norman and I step into the breach. Steven is going to get a “written and directed by” credit, compliments of us. Now he wants to make sure it’s in front. I do some fast thinking.</p>
<p>“So that means our production credit is in front, too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, how do you want it?”</p>
<p>“A Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips Production, same height, same width, first after you at the end as well,” I say, although I have never thought about credits before now. I pat myself on the back for my business acumen... I will get to pay some heavy dues for this credit...</p>
<p>“Agreed,” he says, faster than a speeding bullet. <em>Now, your brother</em>, yadda yadda yadda... (337)</p>

<p>I tell Melnick I want to go to New York to see my mother. He says if I let Steven go to the desert with no one but Clark he will come back wanting two thousand extras and four hundred fifty stallions. I let the remark go right to my ego and cancel my New York trip. We go to Lake Mirage. The desert is in bloom, plus I have been imbibing some evil reconstituted Miami shit and I get a violent case of the sneezes. I know it pisses Steven off, but between sneezes I am still nailing the particulars down for him and anticipating his needs.</p>
<p>When we drive back through the desert, night falls in front of our eyes, first wrapping the hills in a purple blue. And then thousands of stars, crisp, clear, not like in L.A., blaze in the midnight-blue sky and the hills are black against it, and we both remember what we’re trying to do with this picture and we’re friends again...

    <summary>Steven calls later to complain about me yelling out effects in the screening...</summary>

<p>Steven calls later to complain about me yelling out effects in the screening. Great. Now Mike Kahn is a spy. It’s reached the point that I don’t know who is an adversary when there are too many elements in the room.</p>
<p>“Well, how else you want me to get the money for it,” I explode. “I even made up some extra ones, for the overages that will surely occur...” The things that happen...</p>
<p>He backs off. Later that day, going over some ADR requirements with Kendall, whom I have put in charge, Steven says, “Just tell her I know she’s calling me L.P. for Little Putz, not Little Prince...”</p>
<p>I don’t hear from anyone I need to hear from for two days. Then Melnick calls. “Well, I got you the money,” he says...</p>
<p>“Thank you-u-u,” I ooze through clenched teeth. I. Got. You. The. Money!@#? Then why didn’t <em>you</em> run the picture for Herbie Allen while I visited my cancer-ridden mother in New York?!@#</p>
<p>I get off the phone and feed my anger with more blow. I have taken to storing it in plain sight, hanging from a Baggie in the middle of the bulletin board. Coke Theater.</p>
<p>Now the plan is to shoot in the desert in May, come back and shoot the ET and any inserts we need. It is a year since we started principal photography at Devil’s Tower. I convince my parents they should come out here. My mother has responded well to chemotherapy and is in remission. Remission, a friend of mine says: a word that should be outlawed.</p>
<p>I have to start pushing on campaign three: release, marketing, renegotiating.</p>
<p>The whole conception of the release is a holdover from the days when the picture was opening Easter. Now that it has settled in at Christmas, I feel I need to go over everything again. I actually make a team of copies of the charts and maps and dates on the kind of cardboard Kate uses for her school projects.</p>
<p>Steven and I have a marketing meeting late one night with Melnick and Begelman. I bring my visual aids and rest them on the corner of Begelman’s desk. I walk them through the plan: Magazine covers starting in early November. November release in New York and L.A., November 17, a concession to Norman Levy’s requirements, which seem mainly to be that he promised the picture to the Walter Reade Organization. Record release at the same time, so that it can be climbing the charts in time for a wider release before Christmas.</p>
<p>We go over and over it. Norman wants the picture wider in November. It is a dead time of year between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We’ll take the New York and L.A. release, that’s it. I do most of the talking, and I have made a point of no drugs for the day. I maintain a calm veneer, no matter how many times I have to go over the same speech. They all know I have no patience. I think they are making me reiterate for their amusement. I don’t care. I’m on a mission.</p>
<p>It is a very long meeting. They say they will think about it, but when Steven and I leave the building, I’m pretty sure they’re convinced. I am nothing if not convincing. Particularly when I’m on a mission. It is cold and dark outside and we huddle on the steps together, just to get our bearings. He hugs me, starts to say something, but I blurt his words before he gets to say them.</p>
<p>“I know, I know, it’s the old Julia, right?” (339)</p>

<p>Another marketing meeting; I am spent. I throw the blow right out on the table. I have become so arrogant. It is the worst public behavior I ever indulge in, and all the time I play out this scene I am thinking: What are you doing? This is not your movie...</p>
<p>I get a nervous call from Steven. You're not showing this reel without my approval, is the gist. I lie and tell him I wouldn't think of it. I haven’t perfected lying, not even on the phone. He hears right through me, but lets it pass. It’s almost done, we'll all be watching it in a couple of days, I steamroll forward, after I have this one last meeting with Begelman...</p>
<p>Just fucking nail down this fucking ENDless BACKfucking-END renegotiAtion...</p>
<p>I wake up sweating from leftover flu and a nightmare. When I bolt out of bed, I upset a mirror with at least a gram of coke spread out from last night. Jack is in the corner flagellating himself with the cords from my blinds. This is a morning ritual with him. At first, it was just another wacky, hilarious thing about Jack; now it is getting to be a satire of the thing itself, like Rod Steiger’s acting.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a very bad day,” I say.</p>
<p>It is September 13, 1977.</p>
<p>It is the worst day of my life.</p>
<p>I check in with Kendall. “You'd better get over to Todd-AO,” she says. “Steven's been on the phone all morning with Dan Melnick...”</p>
<p>Nauseated, I throw myself into an ungratifying two-minute shower. No time for negative ions today. I dress quickly: Maxfield top, black Brioni pantsuit, mascara, lip gloss, gram of coke. I take off in the limo that has been provided for the last week, I’m on such a tight schedule and I’m such a bad driver. Jack comes along for the ride.</p>
<p>I meet Norman at the dubbing stage. I go in to talk to Steven. He sees Jack and his mouth twitches.</p>
<p>“I'm going to this meeting this afternoon,” he declares. Uh-oh. I wanna see the Beges alone...</p>
<p>“Steven, I don’t think that’s a good idea...”</p>
<p>“I’m just gonna go and listen to everyone...”</p>
<p>“Steven, I’m asking you, please, don't go...”</p>
<p>“I’m going...” <em>Here lies Sir Rupert...</em></p>
<p>“You know, you may be a great director, but you're a lousy businessman,” I say, feeling earth going to dust beneath my feet. I didn’t mean that.</p>
<p>We go to the Burbank lot. There is a message from Connie that Steven, Melnick, and Norman Levy will all be joining us. I haven’t a clue who’s been cast as First and Second, but I know I get to be the Third Man Through the Door. Fuck them! I instruct Norman to go over instead, tell them I won’t attend a stacked meeting. Unless they want to close the renegotiation first. Never give up the product, Jack has reminded relentlessly, until you get the money. I wait in my office for a call from him. They need me...</p>
<p>They tell him that I can “retreat to the standard position of producer” or walk. He calls and tells me this news. I am stunned. There’s been nothing standard about this producing gig so far. Why start now?</p>
<p>I know I should stand up for myself. Go to the meeting, beard the lions in their den. But the coke, which has amplified my courage for so long, turns on me and makes me weepy. I have overplayed my hand and I have lost.</p>
<p>I know that I am being betrayed by the only partners who have mattered: Michael. Steven. Begelman... <em>most fearfully betrayed</em>...</p>
<p>I call Michael at Todd-AO, where he’s been hanging out. I tell him he’s got it all, I’m going home. He worries out loud that we might be sued.</p>
<p>I mention to him he might want to pursue the Artie Mogul offer. When he does, Artie denies ever having made it.</p>
<p>I take the car home. I get one last burst of energy for a telegram that I send to Herbie Allen Hirschfield. It says: BELIEVE YOU ARE BLOWING A BILLION. NO ONE KNOWS HOW HUGE CE3K IS.</p>
<p>I get no response.</p>
<p>Rona announces the following day that I am no longer the captain of the ship of <em>Close Encounters</em>. Since the picture is about to go to negative cutting, and therefore in the dock, there is no way to respond.</p>
<p>Nobody but Frank Warner calls.</p>
<p>Two days later, Grady calls. I think he is calling to comfort me, but it is a you-fucked-it-up call instead. Kendall says he’s been waiting a year to make that call... <em>and murdered on this spot...</em></p>
<p>Randy Fields brings me a final proof of the ad. I cut all the exclamation points and excise the period after <em>WE ARE NOT ALONE.</em></p>
<p>The answer print is run for me at Todd-AO. I sit alone in a darkened room, pad and pen with light in hand. “The experience” seems a tad leaden, cut between the beat. As it were. The effects stay on too long, congratulating themselves. I write heads and tails cuts furiously. When the lights come up, I sigh deeply and tear them up. Who cares...</p>
<p><em>L’affaire</em> Begelman breaks... he’s in, he’s out. Columbia stock is suspended from trading for a day. How did Ariel know that? I weep for my picture. With me gone and him gone, and the power struggles and ego confrontations that will surely ensue, I know the release will be half-assed. I feel like four years of my life have slipped through the cracks. When his case comes up in Burbank, Judge Thomas J. Murphy presiding, he gets a five-thousand-dollar fine and community service... Less than me...</p>
<p>I half sink into drugs. I show up for the screenings in New York and L.A. A press conference has been arranged after the one in New York. I have been placed half off to the side, between Alan Hyneck and Doug Trumbull, far away from Steven, which hurts me deeply. I am late and disgrace myself even further by slurring my words while answering a question. Not the best public speaking. (345ff.)</p>

<p>I loved Milius’s writing, and even his bluster, it was basically so harmless, but he had awful yellow teeth that surely he could afford to have fixed. And he smiled and snarled a lot. I got pretty hung-up on his teeth. Me and Milius ended up not being friends. While we were making Close Encounters, Steven, to whom I had introduced Milius, kept telling me stories about the terrible things Milius was saying about me.</p>
<p>What for? What’d I do to him? What could he possibly be pissed at me about? Maybe it was my use of drugs, Milius being as straight as he was, maybe I was supposed to fuck him and didn’t understand. Maybe it was just another Hollywood Thing. Beautiful people doing beautiful things, as David Debin said.</p>
<p>Just about every morning that I ever lived on Nicholas Beach, I watched the real California surfers, the kids who waited in a row at Point Zero on Nicholas Beach, out past the Bad Vibe Roy Ashe house that jutted out and cut off the view of Santa Monica. They looked like ducks on a pond. Milius was so far behind them he was beneath last. (353)</p>

    <summary>Steven takes a tentative puff on my joint, coughs, and passes it back to me...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>Steven takes a tentative puff on my joint, coughs, and passes it back to me. We haven’t spoken in four years, but we have run into each other on the MGM lot, where he is directing <em>Poltergeist</em>. He is supposed to be producing it, but Tobe Hooper, the director, it is whispered, has lost his cookies and Steven has had to step in. I wonder if Steven has been the first to whisper the Hooper rumors. It would fit his m.o. We are acting as if nothing bad ever happened between us, and Steven has walked back to my set of offices with me, the ex-offices of Louis B. Mayer, which I have defiled with acres of chintz.</p>
<p>Steven has asked for the joint, which surprises me, he is such a straightnik. Maybe it is his way of getting along with me on my terms. We hang out for a considerable period, and I am furious the entire time. I don’t indicate this externally at all, so I am working on a hell of a stomach ache. Thank God there is no Sara Lee anything around.</p>
<p>“Yup, all hell is gonna break loose in this room,” Steven says. “We’re gonna rotate the whole room day after tomorrow...” Oh yeah, I got a better idea of something you should rotate. And where you should rotate it.</p>
<p>“You love doing that sort of stuff,” I reply instead, thinking of Dreyfuss in the cab of the truck, Nick McLean, the camera operator, turning in a 360-degree circle right along with him so that all the papers and ashtray stuff appeared to be rising and floating, the result of the powerful beam emanating from the spaceship above and off-camera. They did it twice until Nick was hurled from the heavy straps that held him in.</p>
<p>We’d only gotten two takes, but that was enough, and both guys were green at the gills, ready to puke their guts out, anyway. Steven, oblivious, wanted another take. Nick looked like he was ready to barf all over him, something he wanted to do anyway, just so he’d get the point. Nick had great respect for Steven on the one hand, but called him Speelnuts on the other. Steven intuitively backed down.</p>
<p>“You should come by and see it...” he says now.</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure,” I say, coughing violently on the pot and my lie. I will never be on another set with you again. And being on a set with you was probably the most fun I ever had. Which gives you an idea of how much fun I’ve had in my life. We have been talking about Michael and me breaking up and the effect it had on all our pals.</p>
<p>“It was like Mommy and Daddy breaking up and we were all your children... it was scary,” he says.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but we made all those calls... we told you we’d make the business part work... we <em>did</em> make the business part work...” So weird, split up and keep all those projects together. Hey, but not as weird as Harry Ufland or Bob Bookman splitting with their wives and subdividing their houses so the children wouldn’t freak out. But that was business, too.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it was like we had to choose...” Ah, Steven, do we really wanna pursue this? Nah... but I say:</p>
<p>“That was in your head, not in ours...”[...]</p>
<p>“How’s the baby?” he asked.</p>
<p>“She’s great... she’s seven...”</p>
<p>“God, time flies...” The last time he’d seen her was when she was a baby. “Got a picture?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said, pleased, and looked deep into the recesses of my purse, fumbled through my wallet, extracted a two-year-old snap. “Here...” I held it out for him to see, but he was gone...</p>
<p>The screening was very fancy-shmancy; the movie, too. The tragedies of the uptight midwestern goyim. When it was over, I leaned into Craig’s ear and said, “And they wouldn’t let me direct <span class="movietitle">Fear of Flying</span>...” and got a huge, rude laugh. I knew I did it because Redford had slighted me. Uh-oh, shades of the Old Julia, or anyway, the part of the Old Julia nobody seemed to like much...</p>
<p>“Jul-ee-a...” Steven says. Have I been drifting?</p>
<p>“Y-e-e-s-s-s...”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I wasn’t a good friend...” I can’t believe I am hearing this. It doesn’t suffice, not in the least, but I say:</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s okay... nobody was...” (405-408)</p>

    <summary>Ah, theTwilight Zoneaccident...</summary>
    <div class="blockquote largequote">
<p>Ah, the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> accident. It is the specter hanging over every production. Filmmakers giving the people what they want. More excitement. More thrills. Take them where they’ve never been before. No bread and lots of circus for the fall of the Human Empire. I’ve done it myself.</p>
<p>No way Steven wasn’t there, I think for a moment, he’s always been so fond of the pyrotechnics. [...]</p>
<p>I flashed for a moment on an accident long ago, during a pickup for <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, the cops going over an embankment in pursuit of three mysterious lights hugging the road, and then going off into space.</p>
<p>It was a scene shot outside of L.A. during the winter after we had completed principal photography in Mobile. A cop car had to go real fast, then break through a fence and drop thirty feet into a clearing.</p>
<p>Mr. Fearless gaffed the stunt, with the ramp just so at a certain angle, but he didn’t want to do the drive. Craig Baxley, the youngest son from a stuntman family, did the drive. He angled the ramp higher and he drove too fast. Maybe it was because he knew that there was so much brass there that night. Stanley... Alan... Michael...</p>
<p>Maybe he was just a young showoff.</p>
<p>It took a long time to hear the word <em>action</em>, and then the moment with all five cameras rolling flew by. Just like that.</p>
<p>But I could tell by the inactivity from Craig’s cop car that something was amiss. I was dressed in the mink, it was that cold. Me and my mink went skittling down the embankment to see what was wrong.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear immediately that his heel was crushed in forty places, because the paramedic and the other guys seemed more concerned with his head. They eased the helmet off and we were all relieved to see that there was no blood, but we could see from his eyes that he was hurt and that he was going into shock.</p>
<p><em>Keep talking to him</em>, I remembered, from other accidents I had witnessed. I knelt over him and talked. He kept asking me if we got the shot, and if Steven was pleased.</p>
<p>Michael came down off the hill and talked to him, and while he did, I ran back up to Steven. The paramedic ran off in the other direction to call for an ambulance.</p>
<p>“I don’t wanna go down there,” Steven said, huddling close to Stanley and Alan.</p>
<p>“Just for a second, just tell him what a great stunt it was, and that all five cameras got the shot...”</p>
<p>I guess he decided he would look pussy in front of the big guys if he didn’t go, although they sure weren’t making any moves in that direction, because he eased down the slope and said a few kind words to Craig, who at that point was vaguing in and out of consciousness.</p>
<p>I dismissed Steven and Michael and I kept talking. Craig looked shivery, so I flung my coat over him. I could tell the other stunt guys felt conflicted about the gesture.</p>
<p>Well, it was a little Lady Bountiful, but it sure beat the rest of the Jews who were standing at the edge of the precipice looking, but not coming, down. Elders from an ancient tribe, looking down on some human sacrifice. A shot in a movie.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I did retrieve the mink when the ambulance arrived a full hour later. At least in this current situation, St. Vincent’s was a stone’s throw from location, and the injured party is removed from the scene almost immediately.</p>
<p>Kilik and Wechsler are hardly Jaffe and Hirschfield, but in my script they are stand-ins, and while we are all performing, I feel a feeling I get too often: I am being deserted and left alone.</p>
<p>I call Bob Wallerstein first and Vestron second. Freeze frame: blood coming out of the guy’s eyes and I wonder if he is going to live.</p>
<p>How do I feel about that? Bad. Inconvenienced. Jesus. The soul of the picture maker.</p>
<p>Which is to say... No soul.</p>
<p>Yeah, Steven had been there for sure, I bet.</p>
<p>And Landis. That little megalomaniacal prick. I had been coming off a plane from Hawaii and he was shooting that dog, <span class="movietitle">Into the Night</span>, with Jeff Goldblum. He stopped the whole production in the middle of a shot to say hello. <em>Little prick.</em></p>
<p>Too bad. He hadn’t started out that way. Like Simpson, he had started out a movie lover and a movie believer, if somewhat neuropsychotic. Michael and I met him when he first came to L.A., with Donald Sutherland committed to <span class="movietitle">An American Werewolf in London</span>, and some prints of his first movie, <span class="movietitle">Schlock</span>, under his arm.</p>
<p>He had an articulate enthusiasm about him that made him childlike enough to seem like a prodigy. Michael and I were so impressed that when Steven was on the brink of hiring Tracey Keenan Wynn (at Guy’s urging) for the fifth rewrite of <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, Michael schlepped Landis up for a weekend to meet him.</p>
<p>Steven hated him, although Michael and I always wondered if he felt threatened, Landis being so child-prodigy and all, Steven pretty much feeling he had the corner on that arena. There’s always someone younger than you.</p>
<p>Landis didn’t get the gig, but hung around Martha’s Vineyard for the summer and made serious bread as an extra in <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>. They got to be big pals long after I had departed the scene. (478)</p>

<p>As I pull up to valet park, grabbing a five out of my pocket: “‘Tang you, missy fi’ dolla, hab a ni’ deener...” I see Steven and Amy chatting with Peter Morton. When they see me, Peter and Steven smile, Amy gets tight-lipped. Hey, babe, better a has-been than a never-was...</p>
<p>“Hey Jul-ee-a, you look cool...” Steven smiles. I am in black-and-gold Alaïa and Porsche sunglasses. High heels. Goddamn right. Cooler than you. I keep my sunglasses on. “Let’s go in together...” he says affably.</p>
<p>Amy wishes she could disattach herself, but she walks in with us. She goes right to their table. He stands at the front with me. Both of us are so Hollywood we know everyone is watching. Take your moment... He says, “I’m having dinner with Menno Mayess... come join us later...” Not on a bet. [...]</p>
<p>Steven and I have our separate dinners, and as we get up to leave, we bump into each other again. “Why don’t you give me a call, come see the compound...” he suggests.</p>
<p>The next day I give him a call at Universal, hating myself all the time, and make a lunch date. I wear a lot of Comme des Garçons violet and lavender for the lunch.</p>
<p>“You’ve never looked better.” He beams. That’s ‘cause you didn’t know me when I was fifteen but don’t say. He shows me around Amblin’. He is especially proud of his child-care center. </p>
<p>Steven, that great lover of children... user of children, I amend. </p>
<p>As I ooh and aah over this and that, I think about how insincere I am. This half-in, half-out of the business is wearing me down...</p>
<p>I think I should take a vacation immediately after this lunch.</p>
<p>We go to his private dining room and are served large salads by a private chef. Shades of Dan Melnick. Neither of us eats much. The chef brings homemade cookies and coffee for me. The subject of the end of <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> raises its ugly head...</p>
<p>“You let me down,” I hear him saying. What!#@?</p>
<p>“I let myself down...” I hear myself responding.</p>
<p>“You let yourself down,” he parrots, stuttering my words at me.</p>
<p>I grab a cookie. He does, too. I let me down, you let me down. I never let you down. Little Putz. But I say:</p>
<p>“Water under the bridge...” and eat a few more cookies.</p>
<p>I guess the lunch works, though; I get a Christmas card that year, after being off the list a long time. (492-3)</p>
